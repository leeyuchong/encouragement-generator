"You're not a hopeless case. Learning a language is hard and with your other university classes, the stress can make it even harder. But you did better this year right? Put in the effort and get it!","Sorry in advance, english is my second languageI failed first year of japanese  studies so I decided to try again, I just got to know I did not manage to get enough points on the last test and I will have to write the additional test (involving all kanji from current semester). This is exactly how I failed the previous year. I did better this year but I have to write that damned additional test again and I am afraid I will fail it like I did a year ago. I have a dream to become a teacher but I am struggling on the first year of university... Please tell me I am not a hopeless case"
Sorry I havent been here in a few days. But thanks so much for the positive words. Sometimes we just need to hear the words from someone else. Thanks and I hope you all have a great weekend.

Hey!  Its going to be okay.  :)  You have done the math and now you know what to expect.  That is a great step to take!   It sounds like this is a big change but change can be good.  So what of you can't pay the electric bill?  Shit happens.  Focus on what's most important.  Do you even need to use much electricity till you get paid next?  Maybe you could cut down on lights or maybe have food on hand that doesn't need to be heated up.   Sandwiches might get old after a while but its cheap to make and doesnt have to be cooked.  Peanut butter doesnt need to be refrigerated so peanut butter and honey sandwiches could be a tasty part of a meal.  Keep your chin up and look for the good things that happen no matter how small.  You guys will be just fine.,"Hi all!Im (40F) just looking for people to tell me its going to be ok.

"Definitely escalate the issue with your work not reimbursing your travel expenses. Do this first thing Monday morning. And, ask they make it a priority. Follow-up on it everyday. The company cannot take advantage of you like this, especially when you took them out of your personal life to further the company.Im sorry to hear about the passing of your mom. This experience is definitely unique in its own way and one that you just cant prepare for or manage perfectly after. You have to feel the emotions to work though the stages of grief, but at the same time, stay composed to be a support system for your husband (and frankly yourself). Geez.Im sorry to hear about your husband as well. The support system that you need following your moms passing and the rock to stabilize the home has been swept out under your feet and is now an added stress in your life. Im sorry.Then, you have yourself you just dont have time to care for. Youre on auto pilot trying to just go day to day. Youre not making good food choices, not exercising and you dont feel valued, sexy or fulfilled. Then, finances are tight and you cant reward or treat yourself. Ugh.I merely repeat all of this because I want you to know that I do hear you. I read and listened to it all. I wish there was advice to just make it all go away. In the absence of that, maybe:1. Let go of all judgment. It is what it is. For example, when you feel bad that you havent exercised, you can think to yourself I havent exercised. And leave it there. Just stop there. Dont make plans to do it. Dont call yourself fat/ugly/etc. Just leave it at that. Youve acknowledged it and now youre done. Youll come back to it eventually. Just not right now.2. Recognize when you are taking on burdens that are not yours to own or cannot control. Taking on those burdens can over-whelm you. I know you didnt want your mom to pass or your husband to have cancer. It has happened. Learn to accept what has happened and focus on next steps. Yes, we all want to say If only my husband wasnt diagnosed... But, hanging on that will be a burden. Focus on what is next. 3. Try to consider what little things can be done to manage your daily. Maybe one load of laundry a day will prevent you from doing it all day Sunday? That way, you can pop some popcorn and watch a movie. Maybe make a batch of hard boiled eggs and now you have egg salad sammies for dinner all week and you dont have to stop at McDonalds or try to make a meal. Maybe buy a few pre-cooked breakfasts (like those Jimmy Dean bowls) to swap out with cold cereal every other day.","Im in desperate need of encouragement and advice or just anything positive.

"Things may be tough right now, but they won't always be. Try taking that test again, I'm sure this time it'll work out wonderfully. Things will start to look up for you, I have a good feeling. I believe in you! :)","Hey, 18 F here. I have pretty bad anxiety and i finally got the courage to schedule my driver's test a few weeks ago. I studied my heart out, took 11 pages of notes on the driver's manual, and i thought i was ready. But I missed a stop sign and that's an automatic failure. I never even saw the damn thing because there was a tree branch in the way, and ended up missing a second one because I sort of went into a panicked state and shut down. When I parked and the lady told me a failed, i started bawling and I ended up crying all the way home and for a few hours after that. My dad (bless his heart) ended up having to call me out of work because when the time came around I was still crying and refused to get out of bed. Having a license is a really big thing for me because it's the next step in becoming completely independent and the bridge toward being able to finally quit my shitty job, move out, and get away from my kind of abusive mom. A lot of people have told me that most people fail their first time, but it really doesn't make me feel better about it. The lady testing me tried to get me to reschedule for Monday (which has already passed) but i wanted to see my school councilor about it first. Unfortunately, this week is the dreaded standardized testing week so I don't think I'm gonna be able to see her, and I honestly don't think I can handle my job any longer. I'm really stuck between a rock and a hard place here. On one hand: i really need to take that next step forward towards the plan I have going, but I also feel so so embarassed and i don't want to see that lady again because she had to see me cry. I'd go to a different driving school but I'd have to pay more at a new place than I'd have to for a retake. My only real choice here is to stand up and do it.Can anyone please give me the encouragement to call back and try again next week? I really need it."
"You got this!  I did mine a wee while ago, I was absolutely terrified!  In my country the pass rate is really low for first time, like 40%. It's basically a given you'll fail the first time, so don't worry about it.  I recommend signing up again quick, so you don't have to worry about it for too long :D  I found on the second time you're a bit more relaxed, and you know how it all works so it's a bit easier.

"I failed mine the first time too. It is more about practice like I thought I'll fail my second time for sure too. Like the lady told me to do a U-turn and I BLANKED OUT like I fucking blanked out. But like I didn't have time to sit there to re-organize my thoughts ofc. So I just went with my instincts and got the procedures correctly. So I suggest you to just practice more and be attentive. Don't panic too much. If u blanked out and got the procedures wrong then, you didn't practice enough. Tbh, it also depends on who was testing you. Mine was pretty nice and even corrected my mistakes. Last but not least, please exaggerate your actions. Like if u can't see the back of the car or something. Turn ur head DRAMATICALLY like u see u, just fake it. Cuz the lady I had said I wasn't looking back. BUT I FUCKING WAS LIKE I PAID ATTENTION AND IT WAS STILL NOT ENOUGH.  Good luck and please don't rush. Everyone is different.

"Everyone's different and we usually grow into our looks over time. Not saying we become gorgeous but with healthy habits we usually improve what nature gave us. I'm still trying new haircuts to find the magical one that will transform my face lol. Trial and error, some suit better some less.

"Almost everyone has been there at some point! Stick in there bud, theres nothing you can do about the sour people in the world. More importantly, dont change who you are for those people. Keep your head held high and know that youre better and more mature than that. Self-image is a struggle for most people from time to time and is completely normal. But dont let people get to you and dont compare yourself to others - these are two important but tough lesson. Kill them with kindness and confidence no matter how you feel.

The negative experiences tend to stick in our minds, and it's good to let them pass through.I'd also encourage you to focus on positive things too.  We tend to become the things we focus on.  It helps to remember that there are blessings all around us, even in bad times.  Even one enjoyable moment, savored and recalled, can lead us to seek more.","Been feeling like crap for about a year now, thought about creating a blog to vent it out since I cant seem to speak the words out loud. I have started and am now slipping back again. I cant share it with the people I know, yet at least.  Just struggling with going through the motions yet again. "
"Hopefully looking back on this day from a safe distance in the future will provide some perspective.When things suck, I always try to remind myself: the bad days are there to make the good days look even better.  Enjoy the sun while it's shining. =)","Just been down in the dumps for a few days. Made a couple of stupid mistakes at work, got in a fight with my wife, and just overall done...

Rad! Thanks for the suggestion!,"Hey all. My girlfriend and I just adopted a rescue dog (German Sheppard) and brought her home yesterday. The thing is, she is a REALLY tough case and really put us through our paces last night and this morning. We could really just use a little cheerleading to boost us up and keep us going for a minute. We've both had tough dogs before, but it's been a stressful time in general so it is extra tough at the moment. Thanks! <3"

Has her food changed since bringing her home? Ours was on crappy shelter food and we had about a week and a half of accidents while she adjusted to new diet. The thing that really helped was getting her some doggy probiotics bc the farts were ridiculous lol. ,"Hey all.

How old is the dog? If a puppy then the energy might ease up a bit. Plus him/her getting used to new exciting environment. We have a half German Shepherd who is 1.5. I believe they require opportunity to exercise and play but are also very trainable.,"Hey all. My girlfriend and I just adopted a rescue dog (German Sheppard) and brought her home yesterday.

"Sorry to hear that. I know how it feels. When I'm going through a time like that I try write down the good things in my life; the things I'm grateful for. I also like to go for a walk so I can be alone and process things. I don't know, that's just me. Everyone makes mistakes, they can be fixed or overcome. Same thing with fights with our loved ones. Don't let those things control your outlook on life and your desicion to be happy. You've got this!","Just been down in the dumps for a few days.

"Take the time to be sad and upset, it seems you need it. Things will get better, and someone at work will eventually make something stupider!","Just been down in the dumps for a few days.

"It will be ok, it's only a mistake if you don't learn from it. 5 years from now you'll likely be light years away from this feeling. In the meantime it's ok to take a moment to be sad just don't get stuck in the self blame loop. Try to start fresh at work and surprise your wife with a flower or snack she likes and I'm sure she'll melt over the gesture. Keep us posted!","Just been down in the dumps for a few days.

"I know what it's like to feel negatively about yourself.  Take heart.  All I can say is: what you focus on is what you become.  Or to put it another way from one of my favorite stories ...Inside every person, two wolves are fighting.  One is love, the other is fear.  The one you feed is the one that wins.You are valuable and worthy of love.  People deserve to know you and to be in connection with you.  I like to remind people that they're unique.  That means that your life is *unrepeatable*.  Your perspective, personality, and experience are happening now... and they will never happen again in the history of the universe.So yeah, go out and see what happens!  You may be pleasantly surprised, if you allow yourself to be.  =D","I have a tough time connecting with my dad (mom died 18 months ago).  I am on the fence about whether my husband and I should really be together.  Sometimes I would rather be by myself and my thoughts than other people.  Sometimes my internal monologue is just really negative.  Sometimes it just seems like too much to call a friend.  Problem is, I have a son and I know I need to open up and show him how a person can connect.  I don't really know where I need to go but I wish the guys from Queer eye could come and just fix my life in a week.  I guess I just have to do that for myself.  I think I need to force myself to go out and talk to other people and do things to bring me in to connection with the world.  I just feel like hiding under a blanket for the rest of my life.  I of course can't do that.  Wish I could be different as I constantly don't like myself.  Not really sure what I'm asking."
I understand how you feel. As Im actually about to leave for an event to try to do that same thing. Connect on some level with people. Mostly because my therapist told me thats what i needed to do. But every fiber of my being screams make up a reason not to go! But Ill go and Maybe enjoy it. Knowing that someone else has the same struggles helps.

"I created a wordpress blog for exactly this reason. Its about 2 years old now. I go there to vent about a lot of things that I cannot tell people in my life or put into words out loud. It helps me so so much. Even if you dont want to make a blog, a simple Word document always helps me to vent my feelings as well. Its a good start. I wish you all the best, OP.

"Empathy is a defining characteristic of a human being.  Maybe even *the* defining virtue.Thanks for choosing to be a good hoomun, u/baghead19.  The world needs us pretty badly, no? =) ","through life we as humans experience meany things. some bad some good all new, we have been hurt, healed, but most importantly helped. i know from experience that life will hit hard and leave you gasping for air needing a break form all the pain but for all of you that need a break talk to someone your friends are there to help you not hurt you if you need encouragement don't make the mistake of laving everyone out seek help."
"Hope you both have a good time!  =D  Don't sweat any expectations about what it ""might become"".  Enjoy this time for what it is.  Good on you for being bold and taking the chance to ask.
