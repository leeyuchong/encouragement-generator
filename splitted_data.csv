Thank you.,"I'm 31. I was diagnosed this Tuesday with prediabetes and high cholesterol. They put me on statins. I wasn't surprised. I'm 360lbs and 5'5.I have PCOS and my hormones have always been awful. I don't have periods, never did even when I was smaller. I can probably grow a mustache and beard. The upkeep is frustrating. I have always felt worthless. I was getting gal bladder attacks regularly for 3 years but I thought I was faking it for sympathy. I spent several months trying to get the pain diagnosed.

Several surgeries to remove my gallbladder and several stones. When I got home I should've done physical therapy. I was always active. I put on weight. 100 lbs. I tried to do call centers.

"Quit the smoking part, it is messing up your brain's ability to feel happiness without lighting your grey matter on fire.","I'm depressed and bored. I'm unable or too lazy to do anything against it. I usually watch YouTube and Netflix all day even though I can't accomplish anything else. I have a lot of guys in my class that I'm pretty cool with but I don't really do anything with them besides going to school with them. I really can't make myself meet anyone because I don't really find an occasion to do so. One guys always busy because he worries a lot about his health and grades, I only seem to do anything with another friend when I wanna smoke with him and his girlfriend is really annoying and doesn't seem to like me. It feels really odd to go in a close friend circle as a guy who just wants social interactions and doesn't think he's special at all. Some other friends are playing video games together and talk with TeamSpeak but they only play games I don't really like and my parents are pretty strict about video games. I only seem to reduce my sadness by eating and sometimes doing some sport and school is like a blessing because I can communicate without planning something out that might just not happen again. I'm typing this text because it might help me feel better by finally telling someone about it. I'm sorry for my English because I'm not a native speaker and I'm just writing without really thinking a lot."

Ghosted by my college friends when I had a family medical emergency and had to withdraw from school, and my best friend blocked me on everything in December. The only explanation I can think of for getting blocked is that she was hoping this guy (who she said had major insecurity issues) would ask her out, and my assumption is that he made her block me.Student loans are beating me down because I dont know if its financially worth it to shoot for my dream.

"In times like those, one of the best things you can do is to remember that your current situation is temporary. It will NOT last forever. Spend it with the mindful intention that you will be a stronger person on the other side of it. One day you'll look back on this time and say ""man, I DID THAT."" Going through it at the time is always soul-crushing and hard, but when you successfully conquer it and move on to those things you wanted to do and the place where you wanted to be, you'll know you busted your butt to get there.","Hi Reddit! I could use some encouragement. My living situation is really weird right now. Three days/nights a week, I live in a small city for my master's program. During that time,  I live in a house with this random older woman (she's nice, but still random) and a roommate. It's comfortable enough, but def not my home and I always feel like a stranger/guest. The other three nights a week, I live with my fiance four hours north in an apartment that we don't love in a town we both hate (it's super rural, we miss our families &amp; friends in another state, etc). So, half the week I'm at school in a weird living situation, and the other half I'm with my fiance in a weird living situation. So, my car is kind of my home. I keep all my stuff in my car all the time (so yes, it's a mess). This arrangement will only last until Christmas break, so I have like 10 more weeks to go like this. This whole thing was my decision and done by my own hand, so I really have no right to complain, but it is still confusing and difficult. To make it all even more weird, one of my professors also hired me to house/dog sit a few nights a week, so I'll also be staying in a third house sometimes coming up. Anyone else ever lived out of their car, kinda? Please share any encouraging thoughts or ideas with me to get through this odd phase of my life!!! "
"It's not a bad thing and it is completely normal. You'll get to a point where you have been raised to support yourself and look to your best friends and your boyfriend for those voids you don't have your mom for. Your mom will still be there I'm sure, but you'll begin to realize you are a woman and can manage yourself.Don't worry too much about your mom. Sounds like she gets frustrated, but she may also be emotional that she sees you becoming independent and will fly away soon. Her outbursts may be up and down like a roller coaster, but I doubt she really means to show her emotions like that. She will miss you.","Ima a 20 yrs female moving out soon with my bf of 5years to rent a place. I feel like I'm being held back mentally because of my mom. Everyday is different with her mood (she isn't diagnosed with anything that I know of) for example: if I hang out most of the day with my bf, her mood is a flip of a coin once I arrive. If I hang out too often then she flips out on me. I'm afraid of moving out because I don't know the outcome of what will happen which ik won't be good. I just need someone to tell me to do it since I need to get out of my comfort zone. Thank you for reading"
Thanks for the towel. And you have my support! We're all pulling for you!,"Hoo boy. Feeling vomit ahead. So, I'm in my last year of college after failing out a few years prior due to a major depressive spiral, and not realizing I needed some major changes in my life. I've made it this far, but yet I am feeling very panicked. I'm struggling with my finance course (I am not a math/numbers guy in the least) and my microeconomics course. I have lowered my expectations from doing well in the class to passing the class. This isn't what I want. I want to succeed and do well, but halfway through I fall down and stumble my way through the rest of the course. I've already put myself a semester behind schedule because of this. I'm so close but I am dealing with a lot of pressure as well. I can't afford (literally) to push anything back another semester as I am maxing out on federal student aid after this year. I have two courses to take over the summer that will finish my degree (assuming this and the next semester go well enough) and I have no idea how I am going to pay for them, as one is a costly short-term study abroad that I am pretty much pigeon-holed into taking. I feel like a failure for not finishing my degree the first time, and for getting myself into this whole mess by wasting money like crazy that last year at my previous institution among other things. I'm mad at myself for letting myself fall down like this. I'm mad at myself for not learning the first time that I need to be more proactive on things. Gah.Sorry for the feeling vomit. If you made it through all that, congrats, and here's a towel to wipe off the feeling vomit. "

He proceeds to slap my phone off of my stand in my car and stomp on it. I become irate and start telling him how I didn't appreciate him destroying property. We get back to his mother's house and she can tell something is wrong with me. So, I ask to speak to her one on one to show her what he did to my phone.

As deadlines come and go, I realized the dream of going to medical school is slowly going away.I looked at so many masters programs or other programs to help boost my GPA but I always fall short of the requirements due to my overall GPA. My passion is the healthcare field, being able to help patients hands on and seeing the progression of getting them healthier over time but despite all that my GPA is whats holding me back. After thinking it through, speaking to other students, and other people in the profession, I decided rather than sitting around and wasting my time, I would be more proactive with it. Im not asking for forgiveness on my past academic records, but I was requisition some solid advice. Despite meeting everyone and anyone about my next step, no one seems to care too much and just tells me to leave the health care field out of my head and focus on something like HealthCare Management or business. I gave it some thought and decided I wanted to do nursing and become an RN and if cards fall right into my hand, use it as a stepping stone for a new career choice or new beginning.

Lately, I don't want to be here anymore. I don't necessarily want to kill myself persay just not exist. I'm feeling like a complete failure and that the world would be better off if I wasn't in it. I'm not remarkable. I'm not going to change the world (although that's what I thought I was suppose to do). At best I will live an average normal existence. I hate that in order to even remotely be alright I have to take medication for the rest of my life. Anxiety and depression overwhelm my life. It's been going on to varying degrees now for the last 20 years.  I've been everywhere from comatose on antianxieties to agoraphobic to disgusting because I can't even handle basic hygiene. Sometimes, every so often, I am actually happy. I think. But the demons always come back. I'm so tired of living this way. It effects every facet of my live. I've lost jobs, friends, relationships etc. It seems the only way to keep the demons away is to just cease to be here.  I've had another fairly bad episode this past week and I'm worried about my job. I'm worried about what my coworkers think. I'm worried about pretty much everything to be honest. The list is endless. I guess what I'm asking is for some comforting words of encouragement that everything won't implode and even if it does it won't always be that way."
"The fact that you're worrying is just a sign that this is important to you, this is a good sign!As something that is important to you, you will approach this return to school with seriousness and dedication. You have seen the type of life you can achieve right now, and you've been offered an opportunity to reach other places. You will either find it worthwhile to put the work required to get to new places, or you'll end right back where you are right now; either way, you're not losing anything!Take some time to consider what you consider success; is it the part of having achieved or reached a destination?",Ive been out of school for 2 years now. I finally have a job with tuition reimbursement and I'm going to get my benefits come this January. Sometimes I worry that I don't have what it takes to succeed and that even that even though in school I've made B's I'm worried my time away has made me less. What if I cant get B's anymore?
Great job! You have made the first steps to a healthier lifestyle! Just remember that there are lots of people out there who struggle and can't get themselves to take any action. There are also a LOT of people who have been in your situation and lost so much weight and were able to keep their diabetes under control with diet and exercise alone. Keep up the great work!,"A little background. I'm 36, male, 290lbs, and found out that I'm diabetic about a year and a half ago.  I'm still overweight and trying the Atkins diet now.  I have been recording my walks to track them to see if I'm improving on my time. Today I pushed myself a little bit harder and tracked a 14 minute and 17 seconds mile. So far that's my fastest mile pace. I was very proud of this achievement because it's been awhile since I've gotten under 15 minutes. Not really looking for any type of advice to make it better just a little bit of encouragement that I didn't receive when I got home. Thanks."
"Been there many times myself.Personally, the last 3 or so months have required me to live day-to-day, which has forced me to live far more in the moment than ever before.

Im really sorry to hear that. May I ask why she doesnt want children? Or perhaps ask her why if you havent already. Is she open to adopting maybe? ,"When we started dating 5 years ago, I told her how much I wanted children. She said she could want kids with me.    Apparently, she's changed her mind and doesn't want kids at all now, and I just don't think I could be fulfilled without children. I don't want to lose her and our dog. I just feel so bad right now."

I finished my original degree 17 years ago and have worked in IT since then but the past year had really made me fall out of \~\~love\~\~ like with that.  I've wanted a masters for a long time with the idea that eventually I'd pursue a new career as a public policy analyst so I've gone back to undergraduate courses in economics and math with the idea if I do well I'll pursue a masters in economics but if not maybe public policy or political science or just go back to work.  Of note I'm married with a 6 moth old daughter.Well...I showed up to my first calculus test (I originally passed it with an 89.6 in 2002 but am retaking it to prepare for calculus II) and the teacher told us we couldn't use our calculators and to put them away. We all panic.  I didn't even finish the test.  Well, I just got back my grade and it's a 37/100 and I'm panicking thinking this was all a mistake quitting my career to go back to school just to try and find a career I was actually passionate about.  I'm enjoying learning but failing that bad has me in panic mode.  I already struggle with depression and I'm hoping to benefit from talking with someone about it.  I don't feel like I can talk to my wife about it. :("

On top of that, her mental health has been beyond terrible for herwhich is likely a huge driving force for the dependencyand Ive gotten Caregivers Fatigue 3 or 4 times already. I desperately want to communicate this issue but she can already read it off of me (been together for a long time) which is making her mental health worse at times, and I think if we were to outright have that conversation it would cause her mental health to be even worse. She also gets upset that it seems like I view her as helpless and unable to function without me, and admittedly I do because shes so extremely needyI hate myself physically. Literally from my head to my toes: I cant find a good haircut and the barber that I helped out with that couldnt be consistent, then COVID hit and Im out a barber &amp; reference point for my hair.

Does not care if we are safe and gets after us if we wear masks around unscreened patients. Administration backs them up. All them are working safely from home. My old boss said she is posting a better position for me soon. I hope she does. If not i may need to do travel nursing. I have gained so much weight from school and from working nights. I am so exhausted (I am in grad school FT now and am working) and don't run and work out like i should. My new job will be better and I'll be able to workout more. I am not as attractive and thin as I used to be and I can tell by the way guys are around me then vs now. It's depressing. I've always struggled with weight.

"Sometimes life doesn't work out the way we wanted it to and it's okay because everything works out the way its supposed to. Take care of yourself and work your hardest to only move up from here on.

"I'm not sure I could help *lots* but here's a good place to start. First, don't criticise yourself for feeling bad about this. Don't tell yourself  'I shouldn't feel bad about what this boy has done to me' because the truth is that you have been hurt, and that narrative will only makes you feel bad about feeling bad. Instead, tell yourself that it's perfectly okay to feel the way you do. Then speak to someone (or a number of people) you trust about it. It's important to validate yourself because that's the most (and only) organic way to begin to recover.

"Way to go man!! That stuff is insanely scary but it's absolutely worth the shot.As for pointers, I dont have many but maybe try something that sounds more casual such as, ""hey, want to get lunch together sometime?"" or ""want to get coffee sometime?

"Life can be an adventure that is worthwhile if you can embrace and become at home with the fact that it is always uncertain, always changing, and that you get the truly profound gift of being able to respond to all of that, if you let yourself be aware and mindful of all of it rather than turning away from the experience.You're stressed and tired, okay, that's what you're experiencing right now.

I am fighting my demons and they are winning. I cant go to the hospital I would lose everything and truly have nothing to live for. Life without reason is no life, so if you say go to the hospital, I will put that in the just kill yourself category. I am in pain, such pain right now I am having trouble seeing that it will ever end.I met a girl before the crap happened, and we went out every week a few times each week for many months. There was a instant chemistry, it was like we had known each other for years. We laughed at the same jokes, we liked the same music, we were both sensual creatures with each other. We had such a great time together, laughing, making out, and just holding each other.We talked about the future, what we wanted to do together, places to visit, things to do, how our live would be together. We talked about getting a house together and cooking dinner and watching movies and playing with her daughter, we created a life that we both wanted."
Anyone else?,"My friend who is a lovely human being just finished paying the last payment on her $50k student debt and is now debt free a day before her 31st birthday! My friend is an amazing person - she is an artist and works to help poor and disadvantaged people get a hold of their life. Me and her closest friends are so proud of her, but due to Covid, we are not able to throw a huge party to celebrate her achievement and her birthday. I thought it would be fun to ask kind internet strangers to congratulate and say a few good words or share advice/tips to my friend. Can you share them as comments to this thread, and I will create a physical scrapbook of reddit encouragement comments to share with her on her birthday tomorrow?Thanks in advance!!"
"Hey man,I'm in a similar situation and I heard a quote that I feel was meant for people like us. It went along the lines of and I'm paraphrasing: ""The greatest moving force people experience concerning their future comes from not the positive thoughts about their dreams and goals, but instead it is the fear of where they could end up if they stop moving forward""I do believe effort matters, because YOU learning new processes and giving it your all is what adds most to your character development. It's always pleasant to think about your potential, but for people like us we have to look at the worst version of ourselves to wake up. Give it your best man, cause being at the bottom of society sucks.","I know that this will sound illogical, I know that it is, but I often won't start projects, or study or go on the jog that I like because I don't want to see how little I know on a subject, how slow I run, ect., ect., I want to study for my chemistry class, badly, because I am failing a *bunch* of tests back-to-back.

"High school were some of the most difficult years of my life. The A-F grading system alone gave me crippling stress about performance on top of all the other things that go on in the background outside of school.Things honestly, truly, absolutely, get better, but for most of us there's definitely a period of being stuck in ""the outer ring of suck"" or even ""the very core of suck"" and I remember when it felt utterly hopeless.I coped by playing games - ones that gave me an additional social group outside of school. I played world of warcraft heavily not really for the content (I was a hardcore raider) but to play with the people in my guild that I joined at random.","I wake up at 6:00 AM only to go to a Place where I'll never feel like I'm good enough at anything.

I turn 20 literally on Friday and the fact that Im 20 with no stable income and barely getting by is killing my motivation and the way I want to handle things in life. I just feel like I have nothing going for me anymore.

My living situation is really weird right now. Three days/nights a week, I live in a small city for my master's program. During that time,  I live in a house with this random older woman (she's nice, but still random) and a roommate. It's comfortable enough, but def not my home and I always feel like a stranger/guest. The other three nights a week, I live with my fiance four hours north in an apartment that we don't love in a town we both hate (it's super rural, we miss our families &amp; friends in another state, etc). So, half the week I'm at school in a weird living situation, and the other half I'm with my fiance in a weird living situation. So, my car is kind of my home. I keep all my stuff in my car all the time (so yes, it's a mess). This arrangement will only last until Christmas break, so I have like 10 more weeks to go like this. This whole thing was my decision and done by my own hand, so I really have no right to complain, but it is still confusing and difficult. To make it all even more weird, one of my professors also hired me to house/dog sit a few nights a week, so I'll also be staying in a third house sometimes coming up. Anyone else ever lived out of their car, kinda? Please share any encouraging thoughts or ideas with me to get through this odd phase of my life!!! "

"Fellow human, I am sorry to hear about your lava lamp. Sometimes dads don't know their own strength. It is certainly not your fault that it was broken, it got broken, this doesn't have to be the fault of anyone it just is what it is.  As for the phone that one really stinks.I have suffered and learned through practice that one of the best things to do is to just focus on blessings. Try to find five things you are grateful for and focus on those, it sucks believe me.

You deserve to be happy and loved and you are important.","Looks like the depression and disappointment hit me post midnight, as Im currently up at 5 am typing this. You know when only *one* small thing goes wrong then suddenly youre all up in a rut about every life decision youve made? Well, Im feeling really shitty about the fact that technically I allowed two things of my own possession to get slightly damaged, all in one night. Due to being lazy in bed, I asked my dad to shake my lava lamp to let the floating hardened liquid to sink towards the bottom. He shook it too hard, causing the whole thing to fall apart and for the lightbulb to lose one of its connector pieces. He said hed go to the hardware store soon to replace the lightbulb, but Im in slight doubt if the lamp will work after that, feeling that its my fault, in technical aspects. If I had simply gotten up to do it myself, then my lamp would have been fine. This is going to also sound ridiculous, but my new phone (no case, no screen protector) somehow slid off the surface I placed it on while doing something this late at night, causing it to hit the hard floor screen first, getting itself some small scratches on its corners in the process. I know the scratches arent that bad, but my obsessive compulsive disorder really tests my tolerance when it comes to the smallest things. And it was a new phone that Ive only had for a couple of weeks, for crying out loud! Why couldnt I have placed it on the floor or on the counter instead? Ive just been self deprecating for the past two hours, so far.In sum from all of this, how do I effectively diminish the thought of I could have done this to prevent this or that so I can learn from these small situations that have been bothering me for the past couple of hours? I guess I somehow have a compass as to how I can solve this, but hearing something from somebody else would really encourage me."
"Hey man, my ex gf broke up with me a year or so ago, and it felt horrible.  Most people have been there, we know how much it sucks :/.

Ive had this thought too. Ive also dropped it a long time ago.,"I want to live with the hope that technology will advance enough that we will be able to rejuvenate ourselves indefinitely. Of course we will still be able of dying of non-age related causes, but at least it'll mean we are not in some kind of countdown. I hate when people say things like 'life is short'. It just makes it sound like I have to hurry everything in my lifestyle and can't take it slow, what a way to do things fast and bad. You can't hurry art!I'd say it's not completely baseless, as there seems to be experiments on rejuvenation already, and I'm in my middle 20s. Of course it does not mean I'm going to live my life carelessly or let it pass me. I already am pretty active to do my best and achieve everything I want to achieve.

I really like your singing! You should definitely keep practicing! :),"And when it came to singing with anyone, I always considered myself a back-up singer. I'm just someone with a soft voice, and I harmonise, I told myself that's the way it is. I should never sing as a lone voice, or sing a melody.

I've applied to jobs online and went to a temp agency but nothing has resulted in work. i don't have health insurance and my savings are being depleted. I have kept my unemployment hush hush, but I've heard that talking to people in your network can help you land a job. I've created a list of 6 ppl I can reach out to to talk about finding employment and support in my future endeavors (going to grad school). I am full of anxiety that what I say won't make sense, no one will want to help me, my lack of follow through will jeopardize things, if I get a job through this I'll fuck that up too, etc. Asking for help feels like an excruciating slow death. Sometimes I think it'd be easier just to kill myself. Normally, I'd rather have my teeth pulled than ask for help and be vulnerable, but if I don't do anything I'll have to move back in with my parents (I'm not sure I can survive that and it wouldn't be easy to do b/c of their own issues). But there's also the very real fear that I do all this and still get no work (but then I'd just look for some minimum wage gigs, but even those have not been easy to get and I have loans to pay). I'm thinking about reaching out to everyone on the list in a blaze of motivation. Can I get some encouragement, a little pep talk?"

I am atheist but encourage people to find motivation and strength where they can.,"For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling.  I will walk before the Lord in the land of the living.Psalms 116:8-9 KJVThe psalmist often had to listen to the echo of their own prayers as they cried out to God from a place of isolation. Even if others are around, we can feel lonely if we forget that God is always there. We don't know who wrote Psalm 116, or in what circumstances, but the situation was dire (Seems hopeless). In verse Three he said the pain of death surrounded him and he found trouble and sorrow. During his isolation and fear, he called out to God, and beg God to deliver his soul (verse 4). But in verse 5 we find Gracious is the LORD, and righteous and merciful.No trouble is greater than God's power. Loneliness is a fiction since God is always with us. Call upon Him today and He will hear you, and draw near to you. Have a blessed day.   :)"

"A teacher I listen to often says keep your ideas to yourself until they are fully formed and you are sure about them. So lesson learned. Now you can let them shoot you down or you can pivot, and use their crappy comments as motivation to rise above. There is a thing called the Crab Principle. Basically when one crab almost makes it out of the bucket, the others will pull him back down. They're just being crabs. You are better than that.

Ive also saved enough money to live for a year which Im confident that Ill be able to get clients by then. It just hurts to know that none of the people I consider the closest to me support me in what I want to do. Its seriously taking a toll to my mental health. Ive been wanting to do this since last year but I just didnt have the right skills and financial stability yet.

I failed mine twice and got a retry on my third trip so really I failed three times and the got it.

I tried to practice beforehand but I didn't have a whole lot of time, it was all so rushed. I feel awful. I tried so hard and I feel like everyone is disappointed. When I mentioned it to people before hand I got ""it's super easy, you'll do great"" and then I failed and now I feel terrible. It seriously is making me sick rn. Everyone's response was just sorta ""oh that sucks"" The worst part about it is, I have made everything so much harder for my parents. They needed me to be an extra driver. And we're really tight right now but they paid the 50 bucks even though we were gonna have trouble affording it and I wasted it. I completely let them down and I feel sick to my stomach about it. They tried to hide it but I could tell that they were disappointed. I feel terrible. I've been beating myself up all day about it. I feel like an absolute failure. I worked so hard :("
"Hey my friend. I'm sorry it has been so rough today. And you know what? I think it's okay to feel sorry for yourself. It sounds like a lot of people haven't given you the care you needed, but it also sounds like YOU are caring for yourself, and that takes courage and guts and strength. It's okay to get tired. It's healthy to be honest about it. And, we are rooting for you and sending you love","I know my problems aren't worse than others. I know of all days today is definitely one of the easiest situations I've been put through in life. Today just hit me differently.

I tried to drive to work after pulling myself together but couldn't go because the road to get to my job was replaced by a ditch for construction.I have been raped, beaten by family, bullied most my life and jumped on multiple occasions.

Then he starts going on a rant and calls me all kinds of names and continues to insult me.I keep calling him out on his irrational behavior and all he can say is, ""if you think I'm such a bitch, I'll call my cousin to come and beat your ass, she has nothing to lose"" I tell him this is not a very good idea to do for him to do. I asked for the babies items we received for our baby shower and he keeps telling me that I'm not getting anything that I didn't pay for. He takes things a step further by saying that he wasn't putting me on his insurance and I should get my fake family to pay for the hospital bill since they want to give fake speeches at the baby shower. He continues to go on a tirade that I'm pitting the baby against him.

But today's email tells me that all of my accounts are being deactivated to ""save money"" and that he hopes the team can get up and functional again in January and he hopes I'll be part of the team then.So I'm essentially now unemployed for all of December which means Christmas is going to suck even more than usual, and I'm probably going to spend the next couple of weeks struggling with the heavier bouts of depression and anxiety again.I've been applying for jobs both remote and local for two months now and I haven't gotten anything, no bites at all.

The note said: Mrs. ? Would you consider to become my friend? I'm 90 years old - live alone and all my friends have passed away. I am so lonesome and scared. Please - I pray for someone. Thankfully the neighbor, Marleen Brooks, found the note and went right over to Wanda's house with cupcakes, and the two have formed a wonderful friendship. Furthermore, Marleen has campaigned on social media to encourage others to be on the lookout  for lonely neighbors who live right next door.""Some of us simply need to look next door, down the street, and into the nursing homes, hospitals and retirement communities. People need people, and people who need people often need the Lord. So let us  pray to God for someone you can bless. Have a blessed day"

I needed this. Thank you.,"We often avoid difficult tasks because we dont know where to start. There may be so much to do, or the job may be so complicated, that were afraid to get going. Before we can deal with this type of task, we must simplify it and organize.Think of the final result. Ask yourself what you must do to achieve this result. Work backwards. Keep asking yourself what you must do. Eventually, you will end up at the beginning.By working backwards, youll break the task down into smaller units. Youll also have a sequence to follow.Check the units. Perhaps you can break them down into even smaller units. Plan to work on only one unit at a time.Doing short segments of the total job will often get you started. Once youre in motion, the momentum will carry you through to completion."
"I know what it's like to feel negatively about yourself.  Take heart.  All I can say is: what you focus on is what you become.  Or to put it another way from one of my favorite stories ...Inside every person, two wolves are fighting.  One is love, the other is fear.  The one you feed is the one that wins.You are valuable and worthy of love.  People deserve to know you and to be in connection with you.  I like to remind people that they're unique.  That means that your life is *unrepeatable*.  Your perspective, personality, and experience are happening now... and they will never happen again in the history of the universe.So yeah, go out and see what happens!  You may be pleasantly surprised, if you allow yourself to be.  =D","I have a tough time connecting with my dad (mom died 18 months ago).  I am on the fence about whether my husband and I should really be together.  Sometimes I would rather be by myself and my thoughts than other people.  Sometimes my internal monologue is just really negative.  Sometimes it just seems like too much to call a friend.  Problem is, I have a son and I know I need to open up and show him how a person can connect.  I don't really know where I need to go but I wish the guys from Queer eye could come and just fix my life in a week.  I guess I just have to do that for myself.  I think I need to force myself to go out and talk to other people and do things to bring me in to connection with the world.  I just feel like hiding under a blanket for the rest of my life.  I of course can't do that.  Wish I could be different as I constantly don't like myself.  Not really sure what I'm asking."

It's what it's there for, and anyone you talk to would for sure have better advice than I would.

"Dont feel like its not logical to be anxious. Its totally understandable and valid to be. This is a surgery after all.Im no expert in reducing anxiety, but if you feel that it is getting out of control, do consult a therapist.I guess the other thing would be to remember that the doctors are going to try their best. Theyve been trained extensively and are put under heavy scrutiny. I have also been told that if they proceed with a surgery, it means that there is at least a high chance of it succeeding.I hope it all goes well for the both of you. It really seems like you care for your fianc","Hello Reddit community!This is my first post ever, and I'm looking for some  support, encouragement and logic about the situation to calm my nerves.About 3 months ago, my fianc and I were in the emergency room because he had really severe abdominal pains. They did an ultrasound and told him that his gallbladder is full of gallstones. Tomorrow, he is scheduled for surgery, and I've been anxious as heck. Now, I know that it's not logical to be anxious about it. Gallbladder surgery is fairly common and low risk. I had the same procedure about 5 years ago and I was fine shortly after. As long as the laparoscopic procedure works out, My mind, however, is still racing with worst case scenarios. He's never had anesthesia, so what if he's allergic? What if something goes wrong, and there's a complication? What if he dies during the procedure, and I never see him again, how would I cope without him?Obviously, I don't try to entertain these thoughts, but they sneak in and I can't turn them off. How do I keep from freaking out and being a nervous wreck until I know he's okay? TL;DR: My fianc is having gallbladder surgery tomorrow and even though I know it's low risk, I can't help but feel nervous and anxious. How do I calm down?"

"That title didnt make a lick of sense to me, you wanna write? start with a dictionary darling","I recently finished a BSc in biology (the thought-process was to start off in biology, and segway into vet-school after a couple of years). I ended up changing my mind about vet-school pretty early into my bachelor's, and that's when I started thinking about changing my major to something artsy (I had always had a passion for writing). What stopped me from doing that was the unintentional (at least, I think it was) pressure my family and relatives put on me; out of all 6 grandchildren, I was the only one who was doing significantly well in university; my two older cousins both dropped out of their undergrad after about 5 weeks, because they couldn't cope with the level of difficulty (I'm not in any way throwing shade, people can choose to do whatever they want in their lives and I honestly couldn't give less of a flying fig). Anyway, I was continuously being flooded with words of encouragement from my relatives, and they very quickly stopped calling me by my name, and instead started calling me ""the biologist"". And, although the encouragement made me feel good about myself, I couldn't help but start to feel trapped in my academic path: ""I'm the only one of the grandchildren who's academically inclined, the others have shown absolutely no interest in pursuing a university degree...Hell, they've nicknamed me 'the biologist', I can't stop now, I'll surely let everybody down"". So, I finished my biology degree (nothing fancy, no co-op, no job waiting for me when I graduated, nothing), but now I've been thinking about getting a Master's in literature, or fine arts, or English (in about 3 years). I'm still scared that I would be making a stupid mistake by choosing a MA instead of a MSc, and that I would regret it, especially since I don't even believe my writing is that good."
"I grappled with this for lots of years. Three things. First, no one can give you the answer. Looking to people outside of you won't serve you. The answer will come from inside of you. Second, don't fret looking for the One Big Right Answer. Answers come in little bites that feel like an inspiration or spark of interest to do a smallish thing.

"How about forgiveness? Everyone has faults, everyone has aspects of themselves they see negative in but without those faults we would not be unique. We would not strive for better if we couldn't understand that it is there to reach for, but sometimes it is okay to look in the mirror and take those faults in as part of the bigger picture to who we are. Mistakes are only practice runs for amazing things ahead, be proud of your steps forward and that you are imperfectly made like the rest of us. Some of our deepest strengths come from faults we learn to use to our advantage.Forgive yourself of the mistakes, forgive those in others, and see those faults as things that give us each a distinct shine and a few stories to tell along the way.","Hey, y'all.

I was diagnosed with paresthesia. I can feel 100 percent on my left side but my right side has diminished sensation and I have to actively think about moving it. I still have to see my doctor and probably a nuerologist  but it's been ten days and I'm fighting myself to stay calm. I see the doctor on Thursday. My current job is really working with me to get my health in order. I'm thinking that my high blood pressure,averaging four hours of sleep a night for the past year and stress have messed me up.But I have totally cut sugar, focused on getting enough sleep and hoping the doctor can figure this out. Please help me stay calm. I'm going to do what I can to fight this and hope it's temporary with the right medication and time."

When I would ask my family as a child to do beauty pageants, modeling or even acting, they would lsugh in my face and tell me I dont look like one. At 10 years old, I was bullied at school for my red hair, dark complexion, green eyes, small lips, big nose with a slight bump and a beauty mark. Imagine going home and telling your family you had big dreams and just like the school kids, they tell you youre not good looking. I recall drawing my face and writing, nose job, mole removal, lip injections, hair needs to be blonde. I presented this to a few adults in my family because they were the ones who told me when I was 8 I needed lip injections, nose job and blonde hair. Some were horrified. Some were agreeing that when I was of age we can start making me beautiful. The older I became, the more people would find my mixed looks to be exotic. I felt good for once. I felt I grew into my looks and I trusted my family would still help me with the surgeries because only then, maybe I could seek their approval for my dreams.There were many times I would say my dreams aloud and people would tell me they wouldnt happen. They claimed Im average looking and nothing special."

Hugs.","Lately all is falling apart,At the moment im in quarantaine due to COVID, i miss my friends every day, but they never ask me how i am doing right now so that makes me feel really lonely...Also the girl of my dreams is ignoring me on Snap and only chats with me about our school and i just miss her too so much and i am afraid that I would never find someone who would love/like me the way i am.

"I think part of the issue lies with relativism, too.  Without getting too abstract or philosophical -- helping others is seen as somehow less beneficial than just looking out for yourself.  The whole ""what's in it for me?"" question.I'm definitely an idealist, and even if holding myself to absolute standards feels unreasonable, it's still worth helping other people.  In a way, unconditional love is an investment: you hope that by being kind, you will inspire others to do the same -- even if the return doesn't directly ""benefit"" ourselves.  The fact that it's an uncommon behavior simply means ... we're counter-culture, baby!   And if we're fighting the system ... we can't lose, right?  That's how the stories always end. =D","I just realized something discouraging.  r/RoastMe and other forums dedicated to negativity are freakin' massive (1.2M?!).

You earned that job. You were kicking ass and your boss saw how good you were. That he/she gave you that position.  So you are not alone because that person believes in you. So go into that office and keep asking those questions and get good at the job. Then one day you will be one of those jerks but instead of being a jerk you will be a better leader. Leadership is not about belittling people and making them inferior.... it is about making them just as strong so the company has no reason not to move you up. One day the joke will be on them and you will be the one laughing. Stay strong and keep learning.,"I'm in a job position I have no experience in making a lot more than I deserve. It's a very technical and specialized position that I have absolutely no business being in. My boss liked me so I was promoted to this three months ago despite knowing fuck all what I was doing. Since then, I feel like I've done okay. Like I get the job done day to day but it's more like I know what to do, not why I'm doing it like that. My only resource for questions is a forum for this particular type of work for this franchise. It's the only one of it's kind. That's all I have. Anytime I have a question, that's practically my only resource short of toiling through thousands of pages of policy documentation to find what I need. Today I asked a question on the forum for clarification and was completely humiliated for it. Several people that have been doing this 10-20 years were mocking me over it, cracking jokes about how my company is fucked with me in this position and how clueless I was. Some people came to my defense and encouraged me to keep asking questions but the people mocking me were the ""hot shot"" posters. Big names of very seasoned respected employees. I felt humiliated and alone. I feel like I can't go there anymore to ask questions, and without that, I'm lost. I do not have the capacity to read thousands and thousands of pages of documentation and policy and study them and learn then by heart. I'm lost. I feel like without that, I don't have the ability to succeed. It's well past my bedtime and I can't sleep because of this."

I will walk before the Lord in the land of the living.Psalms 116:8-9 KJVThe psalmist often had to listen to the echo of their own prayers as they cried out to God from a place of isolation. Even if others are around, we can feel lonely if we forget that God is always there. We don't know who wrote Psalm 116, or in what circumstances, but the situation was dire (Seems hopeless). In verse Three he said the pain of death surrounded him and he found trouble and sorrow. During his isolation and fear, he called out to God, and beg God to deliver his soul (verse 4). But in verse 5 we find Gracious is the LORD, and righteous and merciful.No trouble is greater than God's power. Loneliness is a fiction since God is always with us. Call upon Him today and He will hear you, and draw near to you. Have a blessed day.   :)"

I have tried to learn Chinese sign language but have found it really hard.Sometimes we would go for dinner or drinks which was off the clock.

They discussed about the impact of Covid -19 on aviation sector throughout the world. Coming from an aviation background I can see how bleak the future might be. Any area for a favourable outcome during this time for aviation seems unlikely and we can see the effect on a large scale. Right from production factories to everyone related to aviation is under the devastating hand of the pandemic. Job losses, loan repayments, training halted midway are just some of the negative effects which Ive been witnessing in my little aviation circle. Personally, I have been quite tossed around by this turbulence in past too. I believe once you get into aviation you have to make up your mindset about facing such unprecedented times, as aviation is a cyclic industry a lot of factors come into play and the whole sector depends on these factors to work effectively. And Covid has uprooted these factors and brought it to a pause.During such times, one can lose their peace and its ripple effect can be seen in different ways. When we get comfortable at something we avoid going through the process of re-aligning to anything else. Because it takes away our peace and identity."

"Awesome!  Good to celebrate the successes. =DAs an aside, FWIW, my wife (who's a dietician) says that regular meals are important -- the tendency to skip meals is actually counterproductive, even with restricted calories.  Your body will think it's starving and will hoard every calorie.  Healthier to keep to three small meals on a regular schedule than only one or two per day.Congratulations on your success!  Would love to hear updates in the future. =)","At the start of 2019, I was 190 pounds. This was the result of emotional eating, then starving myself years after I left a sexually and emotionally abusive relationship.One of my family members suggested her Paleo diet. All she eats is meat, and she lost over 20 pounds (good for her). If she eats anything else, though, she gets hella sick.I didn't want to give up my love of food, so when I met up with my girl friends from university, one of them said she was starting a calorie-limited diet and asked if I wanted to join her. You bet your sweet southern ass I did!We limited our calories to be around 1200 calories a day. A lot of days, I had little food, so I ate as much as I could to satisfy my stomach, even though it was 400-900 calories. Even now I still eat once or twice a day.Because I got a new phone, I can finally play Pokmon Go and have a reason to walk around town, so exercise is a thing!I don't have a weight scale, but I have two milestones I want to announce!1) Last semester, I bought a Steampunk dress off of Wish, followed by a casual, over the shoulder corset. Neither of them fit me, as I was much larger than I anticipated."
"Dude you're freaking amazing.  I'm considering working two part time jobs along study, but even that will be tough, and I'll probably drop one.

We've been in a relationship for 3 years and I'm feeling down about it and I don't know why. This relationship has been an entire roller coaster from the start. I met my partner in 2016 and things moved very swiftly. So swiftly, that I ended up pregnant. This pregnancy was mutual and we both wanted a long-lasting fruitful relationship, so I thought. I was determined to do better and make this my last relationship but things quickly turned for the worst.Here are some situations:&amp;#x200B;Incident 1\-Boyfriend was in Miami for his birthday since we could not go on our trip to Mexico together.

"I'm so sorry things are tough right now. I wish I could give you a big hug. I hope things turn around soon for you. Something that helps me when things are tough is to find one thing (big or small) that I enjoy, and do that. For me right now, it's baking. But maybe you like coloring, or reading, or talking to your family on Skype. Maybe finding something you find joy in and have access to might lift your spirits just a bit. I hope this helps.","Ive been on a downward spiralMy fianc and I have moved in together at the start of 2020, which either highlighted or exposed some major dependency issues that she has. On top of that, her mental health has been beyond terrible for herwhich is likely a huge driving force for the dependencyand Ive gotten Caregivers Fatigue 3 or 4 times already. I desperately want to communicate this issue but she can already read it off of me (been together for a long time) which is making her mental health worse at times, and I think if we were to outright have that conversation it would cause her mental health to be even worse. She also gets upset that it seems like I view her as helpless and unable to function without me, and admittedly I do because shes so extremely needyI hate myself physically. Literally from my head to my toes: I cant find a good haircut and the barber that I helped out with that couldnt be consistent, then COVID hit and Im out a barber & reference point for my hair. Im in too low of a funk to consistently care about maintaining my beard which is as frustrating as daily care would be. Ive been gaining fat all of 2020 which not only do I want to lose weight but Im also a nutrition major so thats not a good look."

It is completely eating away at me, I feel so ashamed. I failed because I couldn't parallel park. I tried to practice beforehand but I didn't have a whole lot of time, it was all so rushed. I feel awful. I tried so hard and I feel like everyone is disappointed. When I mentioned it to people before hand I got ""it's super easy, you'll do great"" and then I failed and now I feel terrible. It seriously is making me sick rn. Everyone's response was just sorta ""oh that sucks"" The worst part about it is, I have made everything so much harder for my parents. They needed me to be an extra driver. And we're really tight right now but they paid the 50 bucks even though we were gonna have trouble affording it and I wasted it.

I did, got a corporate job 3000 miles away, I arrived there and they shipped me off to several 3rd world countries to work weeks at a time.

"I would say concentrate on being a good friend to her again for now. It sounds like she is is processing what you talked about, or has some other hangups. If you want to be with her, find ways to showcase how much you get along and how good you are together. Find ways to surprise her and give her joy as a friend. If she loves you, she will come to understand she can't be without you.         If she doesn't, then be prepared to float away like a frisbee, because there *are* lots of women out there who know what they want and who will appreciate and respond to a gentleman with that attitude. Lots and lots.","So, I've been best friends for a year and a half with a girl(I am a guy) and I'm talking the kind of friendship that we can tell each other anything and everything and know that the other isn't going to judge and is just there to listen and give advice.In November I finally told her that I had feelings for her after debating in my head for 4 months. She said she also had feelings for me and we were proud of each other for finally letting it out. However, ever since then it feels like there is a rift in the friendship that I had zero intention of creating, you see, I never fully wanted to get into a relationship as she had just started her freshman year of college and I am in my Junior year of highschool(we're only a year apart in age) so we were both stressed with school. I was just tired of holding it in and wanted to get it off my chest.As it stands now, we still talk but it's not the same. It's not the deep talks we used to have, she won't talk to me about anything that's bothering her, and there is something, she's said so multiple times, I just can't get her to open up anymore. I don't know what I did or how to fix it and it's driving me crazy and it's making me feel like giving up on everything. She's the kind of friend that I really don't want to lose and would rather keep as a best friend than ruin that by getting into a relationship. If anyone has any advice at all, it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.Update: She has a bf and hast spoken to me in almost 3 months. Thanks for all the advice, I've just given up at this point."

"Most of my girl friends that got married at your age have had very difficult marriages and most have divorced. Things at your age are experienced on such a deep level; emotionally and physically that it all seems what happens between ages 15-25 sets your life forever. It seems so real that, to many, what happens these years somehow sets the remainder of the rest.BUT, it doesn't. So much changes after college. Know that as you age, you learn so much more. What ""real"" you experienced builds over the years. The friendships you establish become more cherished. You meet many more people - when you start your career, when you begin to travel and when your networking expands. Cherish your friendships.","Hey all. This is kind of a ridiculous thing to feel but alas here goes. I'm really disheartened by my love life right now- every time I start to wind up pushing the boundaries of ""just friends"", when it's usually not even initiated by me at all, it falls apart when the guy ""isnt ready"" or (usually this is the case) afraid or something. It makes me feel like shit, that they dont especially care and that they are just too chickenshit to tell me they arent into me like that Idk it's happening yet again where he initiated everything at first and then it flipped, where i feel like I'm the one that cares more and it's annoying. So many of my female friends are in serious relationships/getting married and I havent dated anybody since high school. I literally havent had a single boyfriend in college. Everyone I know seems to have at least had a solid dating life? I'm just the perpetually single friend and I dont want to be anymore."

I only have two friends. I got a check for $100 yesterday that I cashed and I have been looking forward to this all week. Even after my birthday that happened this past Wednesday. I had some bills to pay like hulu and neflix which I didn't mind. But i made sure that I was saving enough to I could buy the stuff. I got on the bus. Got some drinks for myself and I got two bracelets from hot topic too but what I didn't realize was that most of my billing stuff happened today. So I went from $60 to $8 cause I didn't know my netflix bill and hulu bill happened today. So after I bought drinks and two cool bracelets for myself, I didn't have enough money to buy my pizzas. I was at target and I had put two digornio's stuffed cheese pizzas in my cart and I was trying to check my bank finances cause I always get paranoid that money is going to disappear.

"Well, I am not an expert in making people feel better. Hell, I am scheduling a visit to a psychologist soon. However I will tell You my ways of dealing with it. First thing I do in situations like that is trying to look at it at the current perspective - the current state of lamp is broken. I can only do something to change this state now but what was in the past stays in the past.","Looks like the depression and disappointment hit me post midnight, as Im currently up at 5 am typing this. You know when only *one* small thing goes wrong then suddenly youre all up in a rut about every life decision youve made? Well, Im feeling really shitty about the fact that technically I allowed two things of my own possession to get slightly damaged, all in one night. Due to being lazy in bed, I asked my dad to shake my lava lamp to let the floating hardened liquid to sink towards the bottom. He shook it too hard, causing the whole thing to fall apart and for the lightbulb to lose one of its connector pieces. He said hed go to the hardware store soon to replace the lightbulb, but Im in slight doubt if the lamp will work after that, feeling that its my fault, in technical aspects. If I had simply gotten up to do it myself, then my lamp would have been fine. This is going to also sound ridiculous, but my new phone (no case, no screen protector) somehow slid off the surface I placed it on while doing something this late at night, causing it to hit the hard floor screen first, getting itself some small scratches on its corners in the process. I know the scratches arent that bad, but my obsessive compulsive disorder really tests my tolerance when it comes to the smallest things. And it was a new phone that Ive only had for a couple of weeks, for crying out loud! Why couldnt I have placed it on the floor or on the counter instead? Ive just been self deprecating for the past two hours, so far.In sum from all of this, how do I effectively diminish the thought of I could have done this to prevent this or that so I can learn from these small situations that have been bothering me for the past couple of hours? I guess I somehow have a compass as to how I can solve this, but hearing something from somebody else would really encourage me."

Unfortunately, this week is the dreaded standardized testing week so I don't think I'm gonna be able to see her, and I honestly don't think I can handle my job any longer. I'm really stuck between a rock and a hard place here. On one hand: i really need to take that next step forward towards the plan I have going, but I also feel so so embarassed and i don't want to see that lady again because she had to see me cry.

"Good for you for going to continue your education! I can relate to going back to school after a long break (didn't go back until my late twenties).

But this is not a decision I'm making lightly, and it's one I've spent many many nights thinking about. It seems every time I bring up these fears with people they advise me to keep waiting until I'm sure, or to think about getting a different degree. They love me and are trying to support me, but I think they miss the point... and I've only felt worse since I began making these fears known. To clarify I'm going back for a science BA in geology, a passion of mine. Any sort of words of positivity or encouragement would go a long way for me.

I've decided it was time to boot it up a notch with a fully loaded pack (35 pounds) and it's kicking my ass.  I need encouragement and advice. If anyone has a word please give it to me. I am a 65 year old female.
"So please don't get too down over this guy. Relationships are never smooth sailing from the start, so you'll definitely meet your match one day. I believe you'll definitely move on from this relationship and into happier times.Edit: Surround yourself with others that care about you, or with things that give you joy and love. Best way to counter crushed feelings of a guy.",A boy I was talking to just starting hanging out with his ex again and I found out. Hes a liar but I was really into him and my feelings are really hurt. Im starting to think Ill never be good enough for anybody.

Any advice on how to get over a mini relationship? I feel like I did all the right things and still failed. :/
You got this! Doing it now will allow you to be done with it sooner. Having it done will be a big weight off your shoulders and something to check off your to-do list! I believe in you!,I havent been doing my school work for a while now because I just didnt feel motivated like at all. Im about to do my schoolwork so can I get some encouragement to do it please?
There are better people to give you advice than me but... hang in there. Your life is just starting and sometimes they start out rough. That can be pretty scary. Im so sorry youre feeling like you are. Your whole life will be full of change. Youll still be able to stay connected to Mike via phone/txt. You should try to get some help from teachers or other students for your schoolwork.,"These past 4 days have been awful and I don't know what to do anymore. It all started on Thursday ( some context I'm 16) I got a call during school lunchtime that my best friend Jay(18) had been arrested for assault, he had beat his sister's  abusive boyfriend half to death so I'll probably never see him again but then an hour later I hear from my good friend John that my friend Mike(15) will be moving out of state because he got his girlfriend pregnant. Oh and not being able to see 2 of my friends wasn't enough I got pulled into the counselors office and told that I will be repeating earth science and that I will be taking a course over the summer. And on top of that my mom kicks me out of the house for 4 hours and I don't have a car so I get to bike in a rainstorm and when I'm finally allowed back in she tells me that I need to fuck off and stop being bad at school. It feels like my life is over and that I'm falling under and that I'm trapped if you have anything to say I'm all ears"
"Start off small. Little goals. Then move up to bigger goals. My experience- I went to Indigo and got a bunch of journals and notebooks.""52 lists of happiness"" ""100 life challenges"" etc, man, I felt so over anxious looking at them all afterwards. So much to do. Would I complete them? Could I do it?(Yes, I got stuff aimed towards myself) Would I be good at it? I actually abandoned them all for a while.",It took me awhile to figure this out but i have a fear of things working out too well for me due to superstitions (like it falling apart ) or just doing so well that i have responsibilities that i cant handle. And it holds me back SO much that i dont wanna leave my comfort zone of doing the same boring things every day even though i hate it so much..Some encouragement or advice would be wonderful:) thanks in advance
"You are whoever you want to be.  That's the whole point of drama and acting, isn't it?&amp;#x200B;I'm no expert, but if you want to act, then you should.  Find any venue or play or musical or show that you want to participate in and go for it.  Maybe consider it an opportunity to perfect your skills.

"Did this in March and thankfully managed to get a job by May. Sometimes you need to take over and not get pushed around. However, there are usually other ways to do this. Unfortunately, in these situations it is generally the case (I find) that some initiative on my part may have improved the situation, such that perhaps I shouldnt cut ties like that. It feels good to stick it to em, but you technically only hurt yourself. The caveat is that youre feeling great to be free of the tyranny. My point here is that part of a job is going out of your way to preempt the kinds of problems that end up becoming intolerable. Get back on the horse and find something else. Meanwhile, enjoy yourself because unemployment (whether you collect benefits or not) is one of the most rewarding/enjoyable times in life, provided you arent suffering (or your family)","I know it's been hard thanks for doing your best."" You criticize me over something so menial. So, I quit. I called my manager explained to him how I have been giving it my all, and it doesn't seem to be enough for these two and despite my coming to you about this on multiple occasions it's not improved, so I'm leaving. I gathered my things told my coworkers I was clocking out and left.I'm at a point now, where I've never done this before. I've always had something else lined up. It's a bit scary, but I do have some money saved and support from my bf, friends, and family if needed. Still it feels crazy to bet on myself for once and not settle for a job just because it's a job. I want to pursue my passion, which is ultimately to help people live better lives. I don't want to be a personal trainer forever it just seems like a good jumping off point with how much I already incorporate it into my personal life.All I know is that I want better for myself and I want to help people better themselves as well.Have any of you done this before? What did you learn? Any advice/encouragement?"
"I can't say I had any relationship experience, but I can say that I understand what's it like to have unrequited love. Honestly, it's completely normal to feel shitty cause of what happened, it's something most of us do when something like this happens (we tend to linger on the what ifs, the why's in a situation). To get over any relationship, I think spending more time with friends or family would be best (or picking up a new hobby), taking some time to forget about those feelings and that guy (who genuinely sounds like a jerk to me). I usually find that being alone just makes me linger too much on these negative feelings, which makes it harder to want to move on from the source of it.

"Don't just quit bud! I think you have the passion and drive to become a personal trainer. It may be that a corporate gym might not be the best setting to start off given that it's such a small clientele, and you wouldn't be getting as much experience. It's good to be at a bigger place where clients are being pooled by the trainers. You got this!!!","Consultation OR client. And I'm trying to get a class off the ground, because allegedly its an easy way to hit new business goals, since it's significantly cheaper than individual personal training. Except I've had two complimentary ""get this off the ground"" demo sessions where only one person showed up, and a third demo session where NO ONE showed.I feel like I really took a leap of faith with this job and now I'm just falling. I'm drowning in failure here and I don't know how to talk to anyone in my life about it. I risked everything leaving that job to find something that made me happier and now I can't make ends meet. I'm one of those people that's always been succesful in everything I've tried, so to be so heartbreakingly BAD at this is just destroying me. Today's that second day where no one's showed. I've tucked myself away in the break room to cry and because I just don't have the emotional energy to be on the gym floor right now.I don't know what to do. I feel like now that I've had a taste of this job and how happy it makes me, I could never go back to something else. But I'll have to at this rate.Everyone says just survive until January, but right now I feel like I'm lucky just to survive until next week.TL;DR -- Risked everything to leave a well paying but severely unhappy job to follow a personal dream, except now it isn't panning out and I'm humiliated, depressed, and crushed."
"once again, a story of a bad teacher in the school system. why do these teachers exist? the school system is dumb. follows your dreams, because you can't rely on others sometimes. but I'm curious, why do you think this 9th-grade teacher did this?","She wouldn't let me move on to the elite choir, though I auditioned every year and had a high score. My friend let me see her scores, and they were so low and she got in. I tried to do the local vocal competitions twice, and both times she would flake on my time slot for practice and then eventually advised me to withdraw from the competition. I moved on to college. I got into a really great college known for their theater program. I wanted to be a musical theater major and eventually sing on a stage in front of people. But that was a very hard time in my life and I ended up getting kicked out of college for not being able to play. I took work in factories and got married and kind of gave up on that dream. But, I still sing all the time. I hide in the bathroom and sing karaoke on my phone. I learn a new song once a month or so just to test my voice. I try to do twitch sings on my stream sometimes, but I know it's not my best and I'm a small fish so my audience is about 3 people.:P And I'm ok with that. I just want for once in my life to blow an audience away. XD When we have finances, I want to get vocal lessons. I'm working on my weight, I'm morbidly obese so doing community theater right now seems unlikely. What would you guys suggest to get the response I'm looking for when I sing?"

And it wasn't until i was 15, still alone and in misery, having attempted suicide 7 times in my life, that I realized something.The only thing worth living for was the enjoyment i gave up. I gave up my life for talent. And now, as i watch people tell me that they have no talent, and that nobody could love them, it hurts. I would give up so much to be bad at something again! To be able to scream loudly in the car or use all my paint just to draw something dumb. I would give up my life for some childish enjoyment.Even now, i have a hard time finding ways to feel alive, even if I've given up things like talent,, and the fear of being alone still haunts me every time i open my mouth to sing or pick up a pen to draw,, but i want everyone to remember something,,,Don't give up your happiness for approval. Dance badly in the rain, sing to your favorite song on the radio! Finger paint some fuckin' caterpillars. Annoy the shit out of people, and have the best damn time doing it.

I've applied to jobs online and went to a temp agency but nothing has resulted in work. i don't have health insurance and my savings are being depleted. I have kept my employment hush hush, but I've heard that talking to people in your network can help you land a job. I've created a list of 6 ppl I can reach out to to talk about finding employment and support in my future endeavors (going to grad school). I am full of anxiety that what I say won't make sense, no one will want to help me, my lack of follow through will jeopardize things, etc. Asking for help feels like an excruciating slow death. Sometimes I think it'd be easier just to kill myself. Normally, I'd rather have my teeth pulled than ask for help and be vulnerable, but if I don't do anything I'll have to move back in with my parents (I'm not sure I can survive that and it wouldn't be easy to do b/c of their own issues). I'm thinking about reaching out to everyone on the list in a blaze of motivation. Can I get some encouragement, a little pep talk?"

So if anyone here has a particular quote or photo that they particularly like and would like to share, I will try my best to find an image of that quote or photo that fits the banner size requirements and change it accordingly for old Reddit, new Reddit, and the mobile version. Or, if you have an actual photo already of your quote/photo setting, comment it via a photo-hosting site of your choice (or PM if you prefer).If you don't really have a preference, I shall pick something I think is nice enough to be the new banner. I'll see how long I can keep this going, and while I might not consistently change the banner every month, I will do the best I can to do it regularly. Thanks."

I decided to join the Army National Guard to find my last year of college. Times are getting rough at home. Parents are done paying for school, rightfully so, but refuse to co-sign on any loans. Knowing this, I enlisted into the Guard. Well two days before I was supposed to ship for Basic Training I found out I was pregnant. The man isnt my official boyfriend, we have been involved for over a year but we got back together after a big break up, just never officially stated were bf/gf. My parents dont approve, mostly because I painted him in a bad light to them and theyre stuck on me dating someone who fits in more with our family. They refuse to let me use any of their cars to drive to see him, and insist he picks me up. Well, at some point in time, eight weeks ago, I got pregnant. When I didnt get my period, but still felt like I was having cramps, I thought nothing of it."

And if you can't fully get hurt, you can't fully get healed.","Hey guys,I just need some major encouragement. After like a month of struggling and some really hurtful things said, my girlfriend of 3.7ish years broke up with me. This sunday is kind of like closure for us, I mean I want it to be an open conversation, and just be honest and loving towards each other as just human decency, but she's just turned on me so fast. Like, just how she talks to me and how she thinks I'm annoying. Just last weekend I went up to see her at her school via train for 3 hours and that's when she ended it with me. I'm afraid that if I let her go fully, I'll never have hope in finding someone else, or that I won't be able to love again.

They're the kind that ALWAYS makes fun, even if you're good, because they're jokesters. When I got into school, I jumped into choir as soon as it was available to me. 6th grade. And I loved it so much. When I got to 7th grade, we moved to a new school and the choir teacher there was amazing. She encouraged me, and gave me more and more responsibility for my section and countless solos before adding me to her elite choir that went around and performed live at different places in our city. Even within that choir, she gave me solos and encouraged me. I felt confident and I loved to perform, even just blended into the choir. I loved it. I moved again in 9th grade. This choir teacher was awful. She did nothing but tear me down, hide me in the choir and ask me to be quiet."

It will not help you feel better.","it comes and stays for a while and stays and stays never fully goes away my depression comes from school and my family it grows more and more every day there's this boy I like a lot and he makes me happier but I hide most of my problems from him because i don't want him to worry school is tuff and I don't know how to stay focused during homework and I cant seem to get the stress off of my back.my mom bugs me about managing my time and she's right but all she does is make me feel guilty and unwanted. all i have been wanting to do now is just die die die die die die die die die die.and i keep thinking about it. I stay up late doing homework because I can't manage my time correctly and I'm getting low grades. my sister, on the other hand, is perfect and has almost all Bs and As all I have is one A and three Cs and a D in my grades. I can be very aggressive at times and I want to get better but I just don't know where to start and I need serious help with it I'm not sure what to do anymore ig. I've tried self-harm to make myself feel better and I've tried takin to God about stuff and he still gives no signs of encouragement and I just don't feel as if there's a purpose to living any more."
"You didnt know and now you do, simple as that. It was an honest mistake that probably wont amount to anything. Your co worker should be more understanding. You are a new employee who wasnt trained in that specific type of request. I hope everything went well. ","&#x200B;Wall of text incoming. TL;DR: I made a mistake yesterday at work by revealing private information about a customer, and now I'm afraid I will get fired. Can someone help encourage me so I can forgive this mistake and stop worrying?&#x200B;I made a big mistake at work yesterday, and was corrected by a coworker. I work at a bank where we need to verify every customer that calls in. I started at this job 2 months ago, and I received a call that I'd never dealt with before. A girl called in from a check-cashing place saying the employee there had told her to call us and verify a check. I wasn't sure what they meant at first, and so they clarified. The company had an account with us so I pulled it up and saw there was no money in the account. I totally fucked up and told the girl that the account had a 0 balance and that she won't be able to cash the check and she needs to call her employer."
"I've missed sooo many appointments and dates and things in my life! Everyone does!! You are human, you will do bett r next time. Please don't be hard on yourself!","I'm such an idiot. Normal online classes are on Mon and Thurs but this introductory session was on Wed (yesterday for me). I misread the email. Did I mention I feel like such an idiot? UUGHGHGHH I want to disappear into thin air right now and forget about all this. It might be weird next week when I show up out of nowhere without having been there for the first session. Well, hopefully I can email my professor and hope and pray I don't get kicked out or something. Please encourage me; I'm really feeling down right now, also because I know my parents will not be too happy with me."
"Let it come into being. Third, the answer may be lots of things. For me it was my own businesses where I could do many different tasks. Some people know from childhood what they want to do. My SO knew all his life he wanted to be in construction, even as a little boy. Not me. I kept thinking I like doing X thing ok, but I don't want to do it ALL the time, 40 hours a week. As it turns out, I found the perfect thing.","It sums it up in the title and Ive talked to teachers, consolers, you name I have. I never get a straight answer and Im lost. I need some encouragement to keep pushing and looking for something because I dont know where to go."
"Words do hurt, and I am sad with you about those guys' cruelty. I have heard, ""Never take criticism from someone you wouldn't go to for advice."" You know, and we know, and even those mean guys know, that beauty is so much more than being a particular color or size or anything! You are valuable and precious and worthy of respect and love, simply because you exist. Hugs.","Ive had less than perfect experiences on dating apps (including racism and sexism), but last night really put the icing on the cake.This guys opening line was telling me that I look like a man. And then when confronted about it, claimed that his friend sent the message. Like I know Im not conventionally attractive, or thin or white, but to go as far as to say I look like a man, really, REALLY hurt."
Sending good vibes! ,"I am currently in the lowest place I have ever been mentally, and I hate myself more than I ever have. I'm desperate for something positive to happen."
You are strong and you will be proud of yourself for taking your power back once it is over! Thinking of you!,"Just need a little encouragement. A man threatened suicide when I told him I no longer wanted to date. I helped him get help and when I thought the situation deescalated, I left. He since has sent numerous texts and emails. Finally, he sent a 4-page letter to my house claiming that I caused all of the anxiety, depression, and desire to end it all. I filed a PFA (protection from abuse) against him. He is an abuser and its going to take a lot to be in the same room as him tomorrow - and to listen to him make up his version of reality, and to fight the protection I am seeking.I am hoping against hope that the judge believes me and is willing to grant this order to give me some peace of mind."
"Fear of not being able to succeed because of your surgery. But wonder if you succeed because of your surgery? Give the resistance all your attention, as it is part of your process right now. Do not block it out. Do not try to go past it. Do not try and be how you used to be. Be how your are now, with the resistance and all. Soon it will transform again.","I feel like I was on the cusp of finally getting my dream job (in the arts), but I had to take a long break due to a surgery that had complications. Now Ive been back at it for 2 months, and I feel like everything Ive worked for over many many years has gone out the window. Im doubting everything, I feel like I dont know what Im doing and I ruined my chances of succeeding. Things shouldnt be this bad after 2 months back at it, and Im embarrassing myself around my colleagues.  Ive never seriously considered giving up on this career path until now. I feel like Ive been trying so hard and for so long that this stupid surgery setting me back like this is too much to handle. Some words of wisdom or encouragement would really help me right now. Im struggling to see how this can possibly be made right."
"Life is about finding a good balance of what youre good at and what you like to do and what you can get paid well for.It all seems impossible right now but it will get better. Make efforts to show your Mom that you are trying. If possible, try to talk to her (dont argue, dont raise your voice). Maybe even say your sorry tell her youre scared about the future too. We all were at your age, every last one of us. A sincere apology goes a long way with even the meanest parents.","These past 4 days have been awful and I don't know what to do anymore. It all started on Thursday ( some context I'm 16) I got a call during school lunchtime that my best friend Jay(18) had been arrested for assault, he had beat his sister's  abusive boyfriend half to death so I'll probably never see him again but then an hour later I hear from my good friend John that my friend Mike(15) will be moving out of state because he got his girlfriend pregnant. Oh and not being able to see 2 of my friends wasn't enough I got pulled into the counselors office and told that I will be repeating earth science and that I will be taking a course over the summer. And on top of that my mom kicks me out of the house for 4 hours and I don't have a car so I get to bike in a rainstorm and when I'm finally allowed back in she tells me that I need to fuck off and stop being bad at school. It feels like my life is over and that I'm falling under and that I'm trapped if you have anything to say I'm all ears"
"There is a picture in my living room of two chairs and two umbrellas at the beach shore line and it says, ""A beautiful life starts with a beautiful mind."" I made a frame for it out of seashells. When I look at it, it reminds me far I have come on my journey of self-acceptance. I don't think I have any ground-breaking advice to offer, but I hope this helps. I hope you know somewhere out there, someone is rooting for you and your fiance and wishing you well. Take care &lt;3","Ive been on a downward spiralMy fianc and I have moved in together at the start of 2020, which either highlighted or exposed some major dependency issues that she has. On top of that, her mental health has been beyond terrible for herwhich is likely a huge driving force for the dependencyand Ive gotten Caregivers Fatigue 3 or 4 times already. I desperately want to communicate this issue but she can already read it off of me (been together for a long time) which is making her mental health worse at times, and I think if we were to outright have that conversation it would cause her mental health to be even worse. She also gets upset that it seems like I view her as helpless and unable to function without me, and admittedly I do because shes so extremely needyI hate myself physically. Literally from my head to my toes: I cant find a good haircut and the barber that I helped out with that couldnt be consistent, then COVID hit and Im out a barber &amp; reference point for my hair. Im in too low of a funk to consistently care about maintaining my beard which is as frustrating as daily care would be. Ive been gaining fat all of 2020 which not only do I want to lose weight but Im also a nutrition major so thats not a good look."
Its best not to get into an argument and never to start one. Whatever someones says just leave it to them. I wouldnt think too much about your friends. If its time to separate then its time. A real heart of a friend would stay through the right and the wrong.,"I joined a discord server awhile ago that has a couple of my friends. This server also has their friends, and one of them is a jerk. I was just in a huge argument with him. He instigated it and insulted me a lot more then I did him. In the discord we tried to make it like a democracy. Then this guy came and ruined it. He has no respect and really just a sucky guy. I can tell his parents are either overwhelmed with a lot of kids or their bad people. He clearly doesnt get the support he needs and hes a bully. I just left the discord and Im trying to get some of my friends to join my new one but only one has joined and he says he might not stay for long. I really need some encouragement right now, so Im asking a bunch of internet strangers. P.s. taking a walk to cool down hopefully it makes me feel better."
"There are some communities that might be able to help you out here too. r/mentalhealth is one of them. I know I might now be all the helpful. Really, I'm just a kid that might not know a ton and is still trying to figure out some of the same stuff. But I saw your post and I wanted you to know that you're not alone. My hearth goes out to you right now, and I hope things start to look up for you.","Ive been on a downward spiralMy fianc and I have moved in together at the start of 2020, which either highlighted or exposed some major dependency issues that she has.

"Feeling depressed about this thought is a choice! Yup, it pisses me off to no end when my wife tells me something like this is a choice. But, once again, she is right (I might learn to accept this one day). Clinically speaking, depression is not a choice. But based on what you just described, it certainly could be.What you have here is a BLESSING! Its right in front of you.",Just tired of feeling like life is standing still while time continues to spin away faster and faster. Please cheer me up!
"Happy late birthday, focus on the things you do well at and attempt to do different things or activites. Always open for a talk",Hello everyone!This is my first post on Reddit. I haven't been feeling too well lately I was throwing up and had a really low blood pressure due to anxiety ups and downs and I injured a part of my back on my birthday today and could hardly walk because of all the pain. Just felt kind of lonely since I have also had a hard time emotionally lately due to a lot of stress and don't really have friends or family like people that knew at all where I am and it's just raining the whole time lol. Still glad I have my bf with me :)Thanks everyone 
"CNA here. I get the exhaustion and the weight on your shoulders, definitely not to the extent you have, but I do understand. I want to start off by saying that I am so beyond thankful for all my nurses that I have worked with and their ability to keep moving forward regardless of circumstance, and by the way it sounds, youre one of them too. The appreciation and gratitude I have for people like you are infinite, and if anything, covid highlighted special people like you that keep on going regardless of who for.Youre going to get through this and you arent alone in feeling this way at all. Its healthy and normal to want things to go back to the way things are, and its okay to admit that things are exhausting.","Hi all, I'm a nurse, working in the time of Covid. All politics aside, its just a really hard time to be a nurse. Long hours, frayed tempers, everyone is on edge. I'm just fried, and I miss my coping mechanisms of pedicures, massages, and spa days. They've been replaced by activities like hiking and meditation - its fun, but it's not what I really want. I come from a big family. We must update each other every week on how we have been. Negative points if you don't make the weekly Skype. Even more negative if you dont 'bring it'and show how you are 'crushing Covid.'I'm so tired. I have about 10% gas left in my tank. I just need a smile, or a nod, or a 'sup' just to say that regardless of where we are, it's going to be okay."
"Hey! I'm also recently married and we've got massively time-consuming life changes going on. It does get rough and on some things you will have to compromise, but never compromise your health! You only get the one body and prevention is easier than repair.Exercise is great for mental health, but with the lack of time and energy can be basically impossible sometimes.","I recently got married, then my wife and I decided to foster, then we moved. All within a year and a half. We both use to be so active almost every day. I understand parenting is a priority but with this current child we literally cannot get out of the house. It's just too hard. I use to ride/run up to 20 miles a week and my wife use to run 10ish and do yoga 4 times a week. Now she is lucky to do yoga twice a month and I might get 30 minutes each week to run or ride. I'm kinda depressed, anxious about getting fat and catch myself slipping on my healthy foods. Wife feels the same. Im honestly just thinking about accepting my fate, buying larger clothes and just letting go. I dont want it but that's what seems to be happening."
Thanks for posting this. This helped me,"Stop hating yourself. Stop hating others. If you know that today you tried your best than you did a good job! Sometimes we will have bad days. Sometimes everything will go wrong. Its okay. There is nothing wrong with you. Just keep trying and give yourself a break. We are all just kids in adult bodies. Be nice to yourself at the very least. Sigmund Freud said work and love, love and work thats all there is , thats all you need to be happy. Work at something you love and work hard, be fulfilled by it. Surround yourself with people you love and who love you. Work at that love. That is all that matters in this world nothing else will satisfy you. Take a deep breath and lets just do our best!"
"""We all have a little bit of 'save the world' in us. It's okay if the only one you save is yourself.""","I would  have loved so much to tell you how God heals any wound.

I am not sure where  your faith in God or any other Supreme Being lies now, but I know for sure that the very God  who gave you this life is the same God who heals. He will help you. Allow Him to do so,  please, because He is a God of impossibilities  I am so glad you are still here. So please hold on. Speak up about your feelings to those who dont judge you. For we cant help or rescue you  if we dont know you need it. Ask for help and encouragement to fight ANOTHER day."
"I know I'm late to the party here; but there's a song, by The Carpenter's, called ""Sing"", that always helped me feel empowered when I didn't think I was good enough. My dad loved them, and this song was always on rotation on our singing road trips. Maybe it will do the same for you! Here's the best lyric IMO:""Sing, sing a songMake it simple to lastYour whole life longDon't worry that it's notGood enough for anyoneElse to hearJust sing, sing a song""Video: https://youtu.be/0mNBv5fwdXY","i really need some help. my family is home, and i normally sing alone. i really want to sing but as soon as i do, i feel really paranoid and anxious that they will say something. &amp;#x200B;i just wanna be able to play my guitar and sing, right now. and not care about anything."
Thank you I needed that. I was laid off with practically no notice and realized I dont know what I want to do anymore and felt useless and alone.

I could just buy the cannoli and cut all this out, but tracking down the recipes and making them has and will help with the anxiety about giving them to her.

I know freelancing is hard like really really hard but its something that makes me happy (I currently have a part time job which is essentially what Ill be doing as a freelancer) and I know starting from the very beginning will be extremely hard but Im mentally prepared for it. Ive also saved enough money to live for a year which Im confident that Ill be able to get clients by then. It just hurts to know that none of the people I consider the closest to me support me in what I want to do. Its seriously taking a toll to my mental health. Ive been wanting to do this since last year but I just didnt have the right skills and financial stability yet. Now I know Im ready but it feels like its dragging me down with all the doubt that my family has around me. I easily get affected by what other people tell me which sucks big time. Im currently organizing my portfolio and other starting a freelancing career stuff right now and feeling really depressed. Uplift me please? Im close to breaking down."
You're gonna do great! don't worry :),I gotta wake up real early tomorrow for my drivers permit test at the DMV. Ive been nervously taking practice tests all day and Ive been doing well on them but Im nervous that the real test is gonna be way harder. I also know that all that slow DMV waiting is just gonna make me even more nervous no matter what I do to occupy myself.
"I have been in a similar situation, PTSD, had to live with my brother but it was for a limited amount of time.  You're doing the right things and it's tough. It will get better.  Making mental health treatment a priority and quitting drinking helped me get to a stable situation on my own.  Never feel like you're alone.","I'm so lost. I moved back home (3 states away) to move in with my brother (and his wife and toddler) when my previous job stopped paying the bills. I was told to take my time, do what's right for me, and not to leave until I actually had money in savings again. I am taking a computer course that ends in an apprenticeship in June/July. I have a waitressing job 4 days a week. The money has fallen to $60/shift in tips plus a paltry $4/hr. It's a daytime waitressing position, as I have the tendency to become extremely unproductive during the day and drink to excess when I'm off at 10pm or later. It's happened countless times.Beyond that, I find it nearly impossible to live with a stranger. The last two roommates I have had that I didn't really know have ended badly. This is why I moved in with my brother and his family. I babysit with little to no advance notice a few times a week (for free of course). I try to stay in my room and not make a mess.

I dont know what happened, but Ive developed a seemingly unshakable hatred for my physical appearance, constantly nitpicking and tearing apart everything about myself.

Im staying up until 5 AM, Sleeping in until 3 PM, and staying inside with little to no motivation to do anything but shut myself away in my room and wait until I can sleep again.Theres something in me that refuses to believe my friends want to stay close, and something worse still that is agitated by the people who clearly show it. I know Im young, Im under no delusions that Im fully mature and that this is it, but I cant shake this feeling that Ill NEVER shake this.

"The best advice I can give, is to be patient with her. Ive been in similar situations, and pushing to open up has never been fruitful. You both are growing, and experiencing new things.

She said she also had feelings for me and we were proud of each other for finally letting it out. However, ever since then it feels like there is a rift in the friendship that I had zero intention of creating, you see, I never fully wanted to get into a relationship as she had just started her freshman year of college and I am in my Junior year of highschool(we're only a year apart in age) so we were both stressed with school. I was just tired of holding it in and wanted to get it off my chest.As it stands now, we still talk but it's not the same. It's not the deep talks we used to have, she won't talk to me about anything that's bothering her, and there is something, she's said so multiple times, I just can't get her to open up anymore. I don't know what I did or how to fix it and it's driving me crazy and it's making me feel like giving up on everything.

Little did I know what effect this intake of news - good and bad - was having on my physical, emotional and even spiritual well-being. So I made a drastic decision to step back a little. But truth is that the news follows us everywhere, it is on our fingertips.However recently I came across a repetitive title that I tried to ignore for a while but it always caught up with me: SUICIDE!!!This 7 letters word has changed and turned millions of peoples lives in directions they wouldnt have chosen otherwise. Suicide has dimmed the light of joy and peace in so many individuals and brought guilt and suffering to those who are staying behind.Suicide has finally made it on my top list of the ugliest words in human history alongside abuse, violence, rape, and bullying.Why should you voluntarily end your life? I would ask. Why shouldnt you if there is no reason, and joy to live?, they would tell me.To all those out there who are considering or thinking of suicide, I am sorry to tell you that  suicide is simply a permanent solution to a temporary problem. And I want to believe that,  when suicide becomes an option, it is not mainly to end life, but to end the pain."
"I'm sorry to hear you're going through this. For whatever little it might be worth, you sound to me like a strong person, given all you've been through. Just remember that your value as a person doesn't depend on what others think of you or how you're doing at a given time. Nothing that happens to you could take your value as a person away. (I know that that might not be much consolation, but it does bring some comfort to me in times of sadness and loneliness, at least...)","Acting positive. Being positive about my job even though it's gotten dire.I'm just angry, sad and lost. I don't have any friends here. My mother keeps telling me that I will find a better job, but I don't want to keep job hopping and getting paid even lower rates through waitress training when I know that an opportunity is just around the corner.I can't keep talking to my friends out of town about all of this. I hate when I get like this because I'm very draining when I'm this symptomatic. Some of them have stopped picking up the phone, which is understandable. I guess I'm just asking for any encouragement on this situation. I don't even know how to take my first step forward. I have been crying almost all of my waking hours since about 10pm last night. Any advice/encouragement for a mentally ill 35 year old who needs to start moving forward? I'm so tired. TL;DR: I'm 35, have a crappy job, but I'm working towards a better one. My brother said I could live with him and now I can't, less than 6 months in."
"Have you tried working for yourself; such as, walking dogs, house work, day care, odd jobs, etc. i know verbal abuse is hard. I lived with an ex who verbal abused everyday. I worked hard, worked a lot and saved up every penny. One night he went to sleep i packed my bags left. It took 6 months to save up. I stayed strong and focused. You can do this. If you want change you will do anything to do it. Just remember YOU CAN DO THIS!!!!!! Believe in yourself and your not a failure. Everyone has failed. Its not how you failed its about how you get up and try again. One of my favorite quotes is if your walking thru hell just keep walking, it got me thru a lot.","I just want to be left alone Ive currently applied for around 4 or 5 jobs for 16 year olds in my area as thats all thats going at the moment if more pop up Ill go for them but if this shit continues Im gonna fucking end up killing myself before I get a job, and I cant wait for September when I start collage and have to quit to attend but then get the same shit again, i fucking hate my life I just wanted a career to be proud of and it didnt work out Im already disappointed in myself that I failed, the least he could do would be to not ram it down my throat that he is too."

I havent done the homework yet, and I know that this isn't the way to go, i should havd done homework first to guage how well i know the material before stressing.  But I've had this mental block all day, and just this mental block in general that I can't actually be confident in my math skills.  And i always have this self doubt.  I just have thus idea that I can never be smart in all things math, I'm trying to have a growth mindset but its so hard.  I know that i have to put the work in to understanding math, and im going to try, but right after im done crying.  I just needed to say it as a stranger online since i don't have anyone to tell in real life, i dont want to put this all on my friends because I did that last night.

I've been on and off slightly sick for weeks, just body aches and fatigue that lasts only a day. Well, a few days ago I had that again, along with a minor fever, but this time the symptoms have lasted several days. It is totally bearable, but I am just feeling really emotional and tired of being sick. Today my fever is a little worse, and on top of that, I'm in grad school and my current class has us reading several readings a day plus long blog posts. I'm tired of having to read all day, write a long blog post, and being sick on top of that. I just want to lay in bed all day and relax, nap, and cry a little. I apologize if this post is too ""complain-y"" and I know there are much more important things in the world than me being tired of being sick. I am so thankful that I can do school from home and not have to go out for work, especially with the pandemic going on. I am also thankful that my symptoms are not as bad as many people right now, but I am also really scared that this might lowkey be covid and the symptoms will ramp up. I could just use some encouragement right now."
From your story this seems like the perfect gift and the extra effort would only indicate that you actually care about her. Don't hold back man be proud of it. ,"Some background: I work inventory for a website that sells trading cards, and I've been mildly crushing on a coworker for awhile now. She's nice, funny, quiet, shy, cute, and from the little bit we've interacted she seems like an interesting person. We haven't interacted much outside of passing conversation because I'm also a pretty quiet and shy person, so the few times I've had the chance I've never been able to think of a way to interact with her without it seeming very forced or making it awkward for one or both of us. The crush level has gone up recently because she got me a cheesecake platter for my birthday. Not an unusual thing as she's always bringing in cookies for everyone but it made my day all the same. I've got the chance to return the favor, but it's not under quite the best of circumstances; She's got a surgery scheduled for this week, and while it's not major she's said she's still really scared (Can't blame her). Add in her having a bout of the flu and she's been in a pretty bad place the last few weeks.I decided to get her something to cheer her up and settled on making her cannoli (I saw from a FB post of hers that she liked it) and spent the last few days carefully finding out her favorite flavors and any food allergies she may have without directly asking her."

So, it was very hard work but I did catch up, although unfortunately because my Autism (it's not my parents fault, they honestly tried and so did I) I wasn't able to do the work required of me to graduate. There were subjects I just couldn't grasp and understand at the time. So, I wasn't able to graduate high school. My Mom talked with me about my future (we were living in U.S.A in southern California at this time, we moved there when I was 16 years old) and she didn't blame me for not graduating. She knew I tried really hard and it wasn't my fault or hers or anyone else's that I didn't graduate. So, anyways her and I talked and she thought it would be a good idea for me to live on disability rather then get a job, so I applied.

While he was in his cast he was itching to get riding again and when he finally got the chance to he was on his bike within an hour of being given the ok. A few hours later he went down hard again. He escaped with a bruise, nothing broken. Now he won't ride and if he does, he'll spend five minutes getting his gear on, get on and ride for 30 seconds and then put it away. He told me in secret he is scared, he doesn't want to get hurt. We aren't pushing him but he is seriously down. All I am asking is that if  you have a second, go to his YT page I'm linking below and drop a comment of encouragement on a video if you can, a simple ""Where's Gabe?"" or ""Even the best riders go down, can't wait to see you riding again"" would make a world of difference.

I could not handle the thought of trying them. Eventually tried again. Some of the ones I bought I do not touch. At all. Others I picked through until I found small things to try. Basically ones I could not NOT complete. Had no choice but to succeed type thing. It slowly worked. I still struggle with my own struggles. Start small.,It took me awhile to figure this out but i have a fear of things working out too well for me due to superstitions (like it falling apart ) or just doing so well that i have responsibilities that i cant handle. And it holds me back SO much that i dont wanna leave my comfort zone of doing the same boring things every day even though i hate it so much..Some encouragement or advice would be wonderful:) thanks in advance
"I'm sorry you never got a response. I've felt like this before and it's awful. Please remember that your life won't always be like this, things will change. You're on a journey, and this is the rocky, mountainous, cold part.

But the people I'm with day in and day out don't know. So in some ways I'm still in closest there, but what's hurting me the most is those who I'm out to.

"I can understand what you two are going through. I was something like your fiance a very long time ago. For me, becoming more independent meant finding the root of my dependency (for me that was working out my family trauma in therapy). Try to have that hard conversation with her as gently as possible. Its like a band-aid that needs to be peeled off- not ripped. Work on it together slowly, but consistently, if that makes sense.","Ive been on a downward spiralMy fianc and I have moved in together at the start of 2020, which either highlighted or exposed some major dependency issues that she has. On top of that, her mental health has been beyond terrible for herwhich is likely a huge driving force for the dependencyand Ive gotten Caregivers Fatigue 3 or 4 times already. I desperately want to communicate this issue but she can already read it off of me (been together for a long time) which is making her mental health worse at times, and I think if we were to outright have that conversation it would cause her mental health to be even worse. She also gets upset that it seems like I view her as helpless and unable to function without me, and admittedly I do because shes so extremely needyI hate myself physically. Literally from my head to my toes: I cant find a good haircut and the barber that I helped out with that couldnt be consistent, then COVID hit and Im out a barber &amp; reference point for my hair. Im in too low of a funk to consistently care about maintaining my beard which is as frustrating as daily care would be. Ive been gaining fat all of 2020 which not only do I want to lose weight but Im also a nutrition major so thats not a good look."

Any advice on what I should do, or how I should get out of the funk all of this has caused? I've somewhere lost the meaning of my very existence and really, there's no family to fall back on.

"I hear parenthood refocuses a person's priorities and perspective on life.  The realization that a new human being -- their well-being, education, role-models, their entire future! -- depends on you *should* be a life-changing experience.  Unfortunately, many parents seem unable to put their children first.  Self-worship is a lonely religion.  Children and society at large suffer because of it. You're doing the right thing to focus on being a good mother to your son.  IMO, you deserve a partner who is dedicated to being a good dad, not just a father.

(2 Pet. 3:13) The prophecy at Isaiah 65:22 says: The days of my people will be like the days of a tree. This implies that people will live for thousands of years. According to Revelation 21:1-4, God will turn his attention to mankind, and one of the promised blessings is that death will be no more for people serving God in his righteous new world. Adam and Eve lost Paradise back in Eden, but it was not lost forever. As God promised, people on earth are yet to be blessed. Under inspiration, David said that the meek and righteous will inherit the earth and live on it forever.

She said she also had feelings for me and we were proud of each other for finally letting it out. However, ever since then it feels like there is a rift in the friendship that I had zero intention of creating, you see, I never fully wanted to get into a relationship as she had just started her freshman year of college and I am in my Junior year of highschool(we're only a year apart in age) so we were both stressed with school. I was just tired of holding it in and wanted to get it off my chest.As it stands now, we still talk but it's not the same. It's not the deep talks we used to have, she won't talk to me about anything that's bothering her, and there is something, she's said so multiple times, I just can't get her to open up anymore. I don't know what I did or how to fix it and it's driving me crazy and it's making me feel like giving up on everything. She's the kind of friend that I really don't want to lose and would rather keep as a best friend than ruin that by getting into a relationship.

Physical and mental self-care is something I still struggle with, but when I muster up the patience to commit to it in ""manageable chunks"", it's left me feeling much, much better about myself. I consider a hobby or project a form of mental self-care.","Ive been on a downward spiralMy fianc and I have moved in together at the start of 2020, which either highlighted or exposed some major dependency issues that she has. On top of that, her mental health has been beyond terrible for herwhich is likely a huge driving force for the dependencyand Ive gotten Caregivers Fatigue 3 or 4 times already. I desperately want to communicate this issue but she can already read it off of me (been together for a long time) which is making her mental health worse at times, and I think if we were to outright have that conversation it would cause her mental health to be even worse. She also gets upset that it seems like I view her as helpless and unable to function without me, and admittedly I do because shes so extremely needyI hate myself physically. Literally from my head to my toes: I cant find a good haircut and the barber that I helped out with that couldnt be consistent, then COVID hit and Im out a barber &amp; reference point for my hair.

I've never worked in a bank before so I don't know how strict they are about these types of mistakes. But it seems to me that it was purely an honest mistake and a learning opportunity. I hope they can see that and give you a second chance. Don't beat yourself up about a mistake though. It's not a life and death mistake and it's not worth stressing too much over.

I work at a bank where we need to verify every customer that calls in. I started at this job 2 months ago, and I received a call that I'd never dealt with before. A girl called in from a check-cashing place saying the employee there had told her to call us and verify a check. I wasn't sure what they meant at first, and so they clarified. The company had an account with us so I pulled it up and saw there was no money in the account. I totally fucked up and told the girl that the account had a 0 balance and that she won't be able to cash the check and she needs to call her employer."

I only have two friends. I got a check for $100 yesterday that I cashed and I have been looking forward to this all week. Even after my birthday that happened this past Wednesday. I had some bills to pay like hulu and neflix which I didn't mind. But i made sure that I was saving enough to I could buy the stuff. I got on the bus. Got some drinks for myself and I got two bracelets from hot topic too but what I didn't realize was that most of my billing stuff happened today. So I went from $60 to $8 cause I didn't know my netflix bill and hulu bill happened today. So after I bought drinks and two cool bracelets for myself, I didn't have enough money to buy my pizzas. I was at target and I had put two digornio's stuffed cheese pizzas in my cart and I was trying to check my bank finances cause I always get paranoid that money is going to disappear.

My semester was postponed to February 17th due to the coronavirus and I went from being fully convinced this past Monday that I would eventually return to Shanghai, to me moving into my dorm in NYC for a semester there tomorrow morning. I had to stay awake until 4 am every night this week because Im in the US and the emails informing us on the situation came in on shanghai time, a full 13 hour difference. All the while still having to go to work each day. Needless to say the past 5 days have stripped a month off ky lifespan just so I can scramble a semester free of epidemics out of this mess somehow.

Im literally moving into my dorm room with no knowledge of wether I will get registered for ANY classes, let alone the ones I want or need to progress towards my degree.

"Maybe you're no good with wigs, but you sew pretty well, or maybe you have an additional skill like knitting or chainmaille that you can do for specific pieces - get involved in cosplay boards and local groups (local groups are easier once you can drive, but you can probably get an art teacher in your school to supervise a cosplay club and do that after school with friends and other students) and make friends that way so you can all trade skills.

I think I'm going to anonymously call his parents tonight and let them make that judgement call because it's not my decision to make. They know him best. But I'm so scared. I haven't spoken to his parents in years. If they recognize my voice and tell him, he'll talk about me behind my back, which will just push me closer to wanting to die myself. He might even contact me himself, which would be the most traumatizing thing I can think of. He might not even go through with it, I don't want to scare his parents without reason.

Amen! Im glad your focus shifted towards Christ. This pandemic is certainly happening for all people to come to Christ and gain a deep relationship with Him and know how much we NEED Him. Just as your focus has shifted towards Christ so has my focus as well and it started somewhere in 2018 while I was attending medical school and had a part time job.,"We lose out on something which was very dear to us, when our identity is lost, hope also takes a backseat and we are left hanging just to be tossed around by the unprecedented consequences, like in this Covid. This begs some fundamental questions, where does your identity lie? What things are you putting your hope on? Weve seen and understood clearly nothing is permanent. This diminishing hope is very insecure and can cover our mind with anxiousness and fear. Its not a good place to be in when everything you trust in is fading away. Did you identify yourself with your job, were you putting trust in your friends all this time, did you make plans to save up on money for future?And what happens when these things are affected. Scary, right?Yes, a similar incident is what Im still going through. Ive been waiting since 3 years to join as a pilot in an airline.

I studied my heart out, took 11 pages of notes on the driver's manual, and i thought i was ready. But I missed a stop sign and that's an automatic failure. I never even saw the damn thing because there was a tree branch in the way, and ended up missing a second one because I sort of went into a panicked state and shut down. When I parked and the lady told me a failed, i started bawling and I ended up crying all the way home and for a few hours after that. My dad (bless his heart) ended up having to call me out of work because when the time came around I was still crying and refused to get out of bed.

I was making $40,000+/yr at a restaurant.  I've worked in restaurants most of my life and have truly come to hate it. So with the move, I decided to try to do something different.  So I got a job in a completely different industry and now only make $15.50/ hr, about $30,000/yr. My wife just got a job making $13/hr.  I'm struggling seeing us making enough money to obtain our goals. We are currently living with her parents. We have two kids and the oldest will be starting preschool in a year or two. We still need to get another car for myself that's big enough for all four of us.  And we really want to start thinking about buying our first house instead of renting. Are we going to be OK? Can someone just call me crazy and say it's going to work out?My wife's reaction was to start yelling that this is why she hates being with me.  Nothing is ever good enough for me and I'm incredibly hard on my self because I want to be and to give my kids everything I didn't have.  And I don't think I'll be able to with only $15/ hr."

I was put into a special class but it was for kids with ADHD which was what I was misdiagnosed with which I didn't have. Well, I never did well in school because I didn't get the help I needed. To make a long story short I just wasn't making my milestones or coming anywhere close to them so my parents pulled me out of school and homeschooled me. Now, when my parents homeschooled me there wasn't much information about it and not a whole lot of people did it, it just wasn't as common as it is now."

I was this underaccomplished loser that barely achieved anything noteworthy in my life, always felt like a disappointment to my family, and here I had just stumbled across something that could change the world. I didnt deserve this, I hadnt worked for it at all, it was literally something I thought of while I was laying in bed after hitting the snooze button.That was the exact moment my psychotic break triggered.

She's nice, funny, quiet, shy, cute, and from the little bit we've interacted she seems like an interesting person. We haven't interacted much outside of passing conversation because I'm also a pretty quiet and shy person, so the few times I've had the chance I've never been able to think of a way to interact with her without it seeming very forced or making it awkward for one or both of us. The crush level has gone up recently because she got me a cheesecake platter for my birthday. Not an unusual thing as she's always bringing in cookies for everyone but it made my day all the same. I've got the chance to return the favor, but it's not under quite the best of circumstances; She's got a surgery scheduled for this week, and while it's not major she's said she's still really scared (Can't blame her). Add in her having a bout of the flu and she's been in a pretty bad place the last few weeks.I decided to get her something to cheer her up and settled on making her cannoli (I saw from a FB post of hers that she liked it) and spent the last few days carefully finding out her favorite flavors and any food allergies she may have without directly asking her."

It's like a massive weightful dread and sadness that I don't know what to do with. I looked up and found this subreddit because I feel like a withered plant who never got any masculine encouragement to try different risky things and take action despite fears, including talking to girls. And I feel starved for female attention as well, which creates a self-perpetuating cycle. I would love if I had men and women in my life who supported me with approaching people socially, either for romantic purposes or just trying crazy things. But most of the people around me seem anxious and not to know how to provide that sounding board. They wouldn't tell me to jump off a waterfall if it was actually safe and I was just scared.Another thing I could use encouragement on is a large project of mine, which I don't know how to start, because much of it requires social buy-in from others to get going. But also, in order for it to get going, it needs social buy-in. So I probably need to wait until I have more resources, but then there's this voice in my head saying ""why wait?"". So it's frustrating."

Admit where you went wrong if you did go wrong and try to explain how they hurt you (if they did that is).As for your friends, Id recommend that you keep looking for friends who do check up on you. You deserve people who actually respond to you and actually care about you.Hope it helps and I hope things get better.","Lately all is falling apart,At the moment im in quarantaine due to COVID, i miss my friends every day, but they never ask me how i am doing right now so that makes me feel really lonely...Also the girl of my dreams is ignoring me on Snap and only chats with me about our school and i just miss her too so much and i am afraid that I would never find someone who would love/like me the way i am. The last few days i had a fight with my parents and my brother and i cried myself to sleep also...It would really help me to hear some encouraging words or some good advice...Thank you for reading my story and im sorry if my english isnt very good"

Right! Youre making a habit you can be consistent with! Great job!,"So when quarantine began, I decided to get healthy. Ive been using a TRX suspension trainer since April and improved my diet. I was working out for about an hour, four days a week and cut back in carbs and processed sugars. My pants dont fit me and I needed to buy new clothes.Fast forward... I cranked it up to 5 days a week and was even more restrictive with dieting. That lasted for two weeks before my body said F U and I had to take last week off. Then I just ate like half a pizza and some cake lol.I think I need to stick to four days a week with a healthy, but less restrictive diet. By doing this, I feel like Im failing to make progress and I need to hear this is not a failure; its a strategy for maintaining a sustainable routine. Right? Right?!"
"Just sending love. It's all I've got, and it's not much, but sometimes just knowing someone who's never even met you is cheering you on helps just a little.","Im in desperate need of encouragement and advice or just anything positive. Im going through a very tough time in my life. My husbands cancer has spread and hell be having surgery this month. Hes staying with his Mom house in my hometown, so were living apart. We probably need to move back to my hometown after a year living hours away since our support system is there and since thats where my husbands team of doctors is based. My mom just died in March and because Im a contractor for my current job, they didnt pay me for the whole week and a half of work that I was out. So moneys been tight. I had to replace my tires recently. Work hasnt paid me back for my travel expenses. Now Im job hunting again and looking for new places to live. Im pretty broke, I cant visit my husband because the drive is so far and challenging and I only have less than 48 hours to make the trip. Im dealing with the loss of my mom, and how Im so unavailable because of my job, but I cant take a break from it because I wont get paid for it. Plus Im just feeling so shitty and unhappy with my body and Im just struggling so much. I know Ill be ok, but like...its just been bad day after bad day. Im a very positive person and have been handling this well, but Im having a spiral moment. Advice, encouragement and positivity are welcome. Thanks Reddit."

"Last but not least, please exaggerate your actions. Like if u can't see the back of the car or something. Turn ur head DRAMATICALLY like u see u, just fake it. Cuz the lady I had said I wasn't looking back. BUT I FUCKING WAS LIKE I PAID ATTENTION AND IT WAS STILL NOT ENOUGH. Good luck and please don't rush. Everyone is different. And there is nothing ashamed of being seen crying. Letting it out is better than holding it in. Deep breath kk","Hey, 18 F here. I have pretty bad anxiety and i finally got the courage to schedule my driver's test a few weeks ago. I studied my heart out, took 11 pages of notes on the driver's manual, and i thought i was ready. But I missed a stop sign and that's an automatic failure. I never even saw the damn thing because there was a tree branch in the way, and ended up missing a second one because I sort of went into a panicked state and shut down. When I parked and the lady told me a failed, i started bawling and I ended up crying all the way home and for a few hours after that. My dad (bless his heart) ended up having to call me out of work because when the time came around I was still crying and refused to get out of bed. Having a license is a really big thing for me because it's the next step in becoming completely independent and the bridge toward being able to finally quit my shitty job, move out, and get away from my kind of abusive mom."

"This is a moment of realization that not too many people experience. And when they do, its too late.The moment of realization and clarity that you just experienced is that life is short. Its a freeing thought when you really analyze it, as you now have this very moment to choose to live in the present. We are all in the same boat - Nobody escapes the passing of time. Those who enjoy the passing of time are unfortunately the minority. The majority of us fret about it...we panic...and spiral in our minds.",Just tired of feeling like life is standing still while time continues to spin away faster and faster. Please cheer me up!
"Praying for you :).  Remember every day you've stood up and gone to class over the last two years, remember every impossible assignment you've managed to smash out and hand in.  You've set yourself strong and done 22 months of this crap, can you hold out for two more?  If you're posting here then you know you can, you know you're capable of it.  Just make sure you're getting tonnes of sleep, eating right and exercising and take each day as it comes.  You've got this.","I'm so depressed. I feel like giving up and I have no reason to try anymore. I've dealt with depression and PTSD for 8 years and I'm too exhausted to keep pushing on and trying to make my life better. I was in university 2 years ago, I was passionate about becoming a social worker, but my mental health took a turn for the worst and I had to drop out.I then decided to take a 2 year college program. I thought maybe I can feel proud of myself and becoming financially stable and be able to finally start the therapy I need.Well I have 2 months left of college and I'm struggling really hard to keep going to class and do my work. I feel like I can't do this and I feel like I will never succeed at anything. My motivation is so low and my support is falling apart. I just need to finish the two months but i just can't find a reason why anymore.."
"It sounds like you are either sliding into or about to slide into a depression. I could tell you that it will get better, but I think that opening up to your parents and discuss any for of counseling would be your best bet, mate. College is a seriously stressful time, people need a different support than just a pat on the back sometimes.","Im 19, in college about to finish my freshman year. Im sitting in the kitchen of my parents house. I dont want to tell them how I feel because I dont want to be a burden. Ive told my friends, but I feel like a burden to them, even after they try to encourage me. My best friend for the best 11 years was put down yesterday. The girl Ive been talking to may or may not have just blocked my number for reasons I dont know. I dont feel like I belong anywhere. Im tired, I feel weak, Im scared, and I feel alone even though I know Im not. I dont know why I feel this way. I have to fight to find the motivation to get out of bed every morning."
"Sometimes life doesn't work out the way we wanted it to and it's okay because everything works out the way its supposed to. Take care of yourself and work your hardest to only move up from here on. Maybe getting a GED or finishing your high school credits are the first step. I don't know if this works in Canada, but I know for sure in the US you don't need a high school diploma to enroll in some two year colleges. Know that you can accomplish anything you put yourself up to.Take it easy on yourself and take baby steps into working towards your goals. Be proud of yourself for first of all trying to get a job and for trying to better yourself. (:","There wasn't as many curriculum's then as there is now and the curriculum's weren't as advanced as the one's now. So, anyways when my parents pulled me out of school I was in the 5th grade but after testing me on a few things to see where I was, most of what I knew was a kindergarten level maybe grade one. So, it was very hard work but I did catch up, although unfortunately because my Autism (it's not my parents fault, they honestly tried and so did I) I wasn't able to do the work required of me to graduate. There were subjects I just couldn't grasp and understand at the time. So, I wasn't able to graduate high school. My Mom talked with me about my future (we were living in U.S.A in southern California at this time, we moved there when I was 16 years old) and she didn't blame me for not graduating. She knew I tried really hard and it wasn't my fault or hers or anyone else's that I didn't graduate. So, anyways her and I talked and she thought it would be a good idea for me to live on disability rather then get a job, so I applied. After 15 years of going to several doctors being diagnosed over and over again with Autism and 15 years of fighting to get on disability or any help for my Autism at all and being denied for any help and disability over and over again for 15 years I was done, I had enough."
"Hey Carbon, you sound really intelligent from how you write! You've got a plan towards your dreams, it just wasn't what you originally thought it was going to be. Life is like that sometimes. It takes a really strong person to stand up from failure and continue to persevere to their dreams. I believe in you and your capability to one day become a doctor. Nursing could also give you a unique perspective on medicine, which is something that will set you apart from other applicants when you decide to apply. You've got this! I'm cheering for you, and I am inspired by your ability to self reflect and move forward with a plan that you believe is right for you, regardless of the opinions of those who don't believe in you.","Which in my eyes was a good thing because a lot of people apply and most dont get interviews. Well if I could cut the curve and gone to interviews then I beat more than the people and had a higher chance. However I ultimately didnt get accepted. So I decided it was time to not necessarily stop my dreams of medical school, but rather but it on pause and do something else for a bit and if the cards play out, reapply to medical school later down the road. Focusing and narrowing down to what I liked to do best, I found myself pursuing nursing. I looked at a lot of nursing programs in my home state of Alabama, and found that most of them require at least a 3.0 for a BSN program but if I wanted to do a ADN program it ranged from a minimum gpa of 2.0-2.8ish. My mindset is that I wasted a lot of time focusing on trying to get into medical school that I really needed to become serious and not waste anymore time. I want to start a program in the spring of 2021. Most application deadlines are October 6."
PM me please. I feel what youre going through,"I [19F] just broke up with my boyfriend [22M] I am heartbroken and lost. I met him a couple months ago and I fell so hard and so fast for him.

I dont know what happened, but Ive developed a seemingly unshakable hatred for my physical appearance, constantly nitpicking and tearing apart everything about myself.

Im staying up until 5 AM, Sleeping in until 3 PM, and staying inside with little to no motivation to do anything but shut myself away in my room and wait until I can sleep again.Theres something in me that refuses to believe my friends want to stay close, and something worse still that is agitated by the people who clearly show it. I know Im young, Im under no delusions that Im fully mature and that this is it, but I cant shake this feeling that Ill NEVER shake this.

But where to start?The fact I had to file bankruptcy a year ago?A fresh divorce because my wife didn't know what to do with herself; so I encouraged her to, at least, go to college and start fresh?The fact all of my teeth got removed at the end of 2020 due to poor inherited genes?Or maybe the current, crushing and bitter loneliness I know I need to overcome. Most of my friends evacuated the scene when I got married, partly my own fault for being an introvert that enjoys company, and going out, but rarely seeks it out. I also put my priorities into working, paying the bills, and focusing on the woman I loved, and trying to help her grow.That divorce wasn't bitter, as I do love her deeply - but whether or not there's a relationship of any kind going forward is a bit of a wildcard. In the end it was something we both decided would be good for her so that she could get real-life experience, and an education, so she could develop her own career and stand on her own two feet. I respect her, so she deserves that opportunity. But due to the bankruptcy I wouldn't have been able to put her through college myself."

"One retake of one class will most likely not keep you out if vet school, especially if you retake it when your mental health is better and you rock it. I know vet school is harder, but I was Pre-Optometry up until my last year of college so I've researched this kind of stuff for that.","I transferred to a new school this semester with a 3.7 GPA, but since transferring I've been struggling a lot. The workload and material aren't any more difficult than before, but I'm guessing the transition to a new school out of state and away from my family for the first time, in addition to being sick 5 times during the semester, has made it difficult. I have an A, Bs and a C in my other classes at the moment, but my current biology class is the only one I have an F in. I've never failed a class before and I'm trying my hardest to redeem myself and ace the last two exams, but my confidence is not there. I'm already a semester behind because of transferring, I don't want to have to retake a class, and I don't know if I can get into vet school if I do fail. I've been having a panic attack all day and I know it's extreme, but I can't stop thinking about giving up and just dropping everything. I ask for words of encouragement to help me stay motivated through this."

I walk up the sidewalk a little bit to calm down and when I return to my car he is blocking my driver side door. I ask him to move several times and he refuses.

Little did I know what effect this intake of news - good and bad - was having on my physical, emotional and even spiritual well-being. So I made a drastic decision to step back a little. But truth is that the news follows us everywhere, it is on our fingertips.However recently I came across a repetitive title that I tried to ignore for a while but it always caught up with me: SUICIDE!!!This 7 letters word has changed and turned millions of peoples lives in directions they wouldnt have chosen otherwise. Suicide has dimmed the light of joy and peace in so many individuals and brought guilt and suffering to those who are staying behind.Suicide has finally made it on my top list of the ugliest words in human history alongside abuse, violence, rape, and bullying.Why should you voluntarily end your life? I would ask. Why shouldnt you if there is no reason, and joy to live?, they would tell me.To all those out there who are considering or thinking of suicide, I am sorry to tell you that  suicide is simply a permanent solution to a temporary problem. And I want to believe that,  when suicide becomes an option, it is not mainly to end life, but to end the pain."
"I wanted to play dungeons and dragons but there wasnt a way for me to go (and I didn't know you could do it online) so I also got very into forum-based roleplay.

"The best advice I can give, is to be patient with her. Ive been in similar situations, and pushing to open up has never been fruitful. You both are growing, and experiencing new things. She probably doesnt know how to communicate her feelings just yet. I know it may be hard, but focus on building you at the same time letting her know youre still her best friend.","So, I've been best friends for a year and a half with a girl(I am a guy) and I'm talking the kind of friendship that we can tell each other anything and everything and know that the other isn't going to judge and is just there to listen and give advice.In November I finally told her that I had feelings for her after debating in my head for 4 months. She said she also had feelings for me and we were proud of each other for finally letting it out. However, ever since then it feels like there is a rift in the friendship that I had zero intention of creating, you see, I never fully wanted to get into a relationship as she had just started her freshman year of college and I am in my Junior year of highschool(we're only a year apart in age) so we were both stressed with school. I was just tired of holding it in and wanted to get it off my chest.As it stands now, we still talk but it's not the same. It's not the deep talks we used to have, she won't talk to me about anything that's bothering her, and there is something, she's said so multiple times, I just can't get her to open up anymore. I don't know what I did or how to fix it and it's driving me crazy and it's making me feel like giving up on everything. She's the kind of friend that I really don't want to lose and would rather keep as a best friend than ruin that by getting into a relationship. If anyone has any advice at all, it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.Update: She has a bf and hast spoken to me in almost 3 months. Thanks for all the advice, I've just given up at this point."
"Touch.  I'm definately one who is prone to being overwhelmed. Last few years I've adopted the mantra '*think* globally, but *act* locally'....It may sound cheesy but at the end of the day, thats all most of us have any control over...Also, It's important to recognize that change is constant and we're all just doing our best to keep up and adapt. If you compare humanity now vs. 500 years ago, our progress is undeniable. Growth is an Immortal struggle.P.S - might I suggest breaking this post into 3 or 4 separate paragraphs? Your point is valid but I fear it will be ignored by many for appearing as just a wall of text.","A big question I think a lot of people are asking these days is why are we so depressed, why are we so anxious. We are more anxious and depressed these days because of our culture. With the internet and media we are under a microscope and we are constantly being pressured to be perfect. Perfect body, perfect skin, perfect routine, perfect eating habits, the way you sleep, the way the way you stand, the way you parent, perfect fulfilled fun lives. Every single thing we do we are pressured with the fact that we arent good enough. We arent doing it right. We arent doing it perfectly. We live in an illusion that some people are but its all just a magic trick. People put on a fake face. No one truly knows whats real anymore, so we sit there thinking we arent good enough, we arent as good as everyone else. We have access to all the bad news around the world like never  before. So on top of being perfect we have things like global warming, the entire world that needs to be fixed to worry about too. So let me just say this...Slow down. You will not be perfect. You will not live those glamorous lives you think are real. Just stop striving for perfect and start striving for your best, you will never fall short. Work hard, love hard, and take care of yourself."
"Another great resource is possibly talking to a doctor if you are able to, maybe getting a referral to a therapist or possibly taking medication to aid you. I am oversimplifying depression greatly, and making it sound simple to combat, which it is not, but it is possible to make it easier if that is something you may have.You know this, but yes, you are still very young, and have made it this far in life dealing with a plethora of who knows what. This is just another thing to combat and make you even more stronger.

I got a check for $100 yesterday that I cashed and I have been looking forward to this all week. Even after my birthday that happened this past Wednesday. I had some bills to pay like hulu and neflix which I didn't mind. But i made sure that I was saving enough to I could buy the stuff. I got on the bus. Got some drinks for myself and I got two bracelets from hot topic too but what I didn't realize was that most of my billing stuff happened today. So I went from $60 to $8 cause I didn't know my netflix bill and hulu bill happened today. So after I bought drinks and two cool bracelets for myself, I didn't have enough money to buy my pizzas. I was at target and I had put two digornio's stuffed cheese pizzas in my cart and I was trying to check my bank finances cause I always get paranoid that money is going to disappear.

","I've taken on a 3-year university course that is said to be really tough, but it's something I'm truly interested in. The thing about this university is that there is no project work, no presentation or participation points to help my grade- EVERYTHING is based on the results of a year-end exam. Last year, I failed ALL my modules and had to resit them, which makes me one year behind. This year, I managed to clear two of my toughest modules, but I failed the other two, which means that I now will take 5 years to graduate.My parents and friends are telling me not to beat myself up over it, but I can't help but feel so, so disappointed that I did not pass everything. I had such expectations for myself too.I guess I really feel insecure about graduating a lot later than everyone else I know. I feel really depressed that I can't do well in something that I like."

That's one hell of a turnaround! in case you didn't know you'll see some huge benefits from that. Masturbating releases calming hormones that usually make you feel lazy self-conscious or otherwise useless. it might get harder to resist the urge but the longer you go the more you'll notice you have more energy and drive to get things done. You'll also be more motivated and confident in talking to the opposite sex.

I want to thank you guys for commenting and encouraging me. Ive read your comments many times over the last few days. It has been awhile since I have felt like anyone was rooting for me.  Thank you.,"Cooking, cleaning, planning meals, doing odd jobs for money. Ive lost everything it feels like but our room mate is covering us for now. I got us food stamps and medicaid and Im trying to get help, hence the diagnosis. Please don't harass me about being on snap, I don't want to be on it and they only give me 25$ a week. Have you ever tried to feed 2 adults on that amount? It's ramen and bread and my weight just stays the same. I lost weight on keto a few years ago. 50 lbs. It alleviated my pcos symptoms. I was so happy. But I can't afford it now. I keep trying. I know that I need to suck it up and suffer through. I know that I should eat eggs for every meal and canned tuna and lose the weight by sheer determination. I know that the pain in my hips and ankles is nothing and I should just walk through it. I know I should take a job and just grind it out every day. But when I think about the pain of that, I feel like giving up and dying. I just don't think that I can do it, or this anymore. I have plans to see a therapist. I have to ramp up to it. I make a bunch of calls and then I am burnt out and have to ramp up to it again. And yes, I know. I should just suck it up and call."
"I am at the one place that I felt loved in my entire life. A 3 year old showed me love and acceptance that day, it was also the day that her mother started distancing from me.

I have had only heartache for many years while trying to find someone to be with. I get hurt each time I let my heart believe. This time its different, I truly love her like no other before and I want to be with her, to help support her to help he with the stress of life, to be her partner in life. I want to go to sleep with her in my arms and wake up and her be the first thing I see in the morning. I want to do all the things we talked about doing, the bucket list of family adventures.I dont know that I will get over this breakup, not even sure it would be called a breakup more like a harsh dump from her. I am of no value anymore, I don't even have enough value to say goodbye to. I only desired to be wanted, someone who would want to be with me, who wanted me to be part of their life, someone who loved me. Unconditional love, a love that is true.I want to die right now, and I hate myself for going that direction."
share here!  i will give you the most positively worded feedback but still very honest.  hope i can help,"Hello, it's been a long-time secret hobby of mine to record myself playing instruments for fun, but i never had the guts to share my small projects with anyone close to me. Not a single soul. The thought itself is nerve-wracking for me.Early this year, I created a YT channel where I can start first by making covers before posting my own-----except that I am still too nervous to share it with others. There are a few views but from strangers, so it makes me less anxious that people do not know it is me. Just now, I did try sharing it with a few friends, who are still yet to respond. In the meantime, it's making my stomach churn.Generally, I think I am just scared of disappointing them.I know I need to let others hear my outputs because I need feedback to improve and grow.

"You're in the best position to assess this, but I think it's a great idea! As long as YOU don't give off any passive/aggressive vibes when you give it to her (how much better is this than your cheescake, amiright) I really don't see how you can go wrong. Good luck dude! Invite all of us in the comments to your wedding :P","Some background: I work inventory for a website that sells trading cards, and I've been mildly crushing on a coworker for awhile now. She's nice, funny, quiet, shy, cute, and from the little bit we've interacted she seems like an interesting person. We haven't interacted much outside of passing conversation because I'm also a pretty quiet and shy person, so the few times I've had the chance I've never been able to think of a way to interact with her without it seeming very forced or making it awkward for one or both of us. The crush level has gone up recently because she got me a cheesecake platter for my birthday. Not an unusual thing as she's always bringing in cookies for everyone but it made my day all the same. I've got the chance to return the favor, but it's not under quite the best of circumstances; She's got a surgery scheduled for this week, and while it's not major she's said she's still really scared (Can't blame her). Add in her having a bout of the flu and she's been in a pretty bad place the last few weeks.I decided to get her something to cheer her up and settled on making her cannoli (I saw from a FB post of hers that she liked it) and spent the last few days carefully finding out her favorite flavors and any food allergies she may have without directly asking her."

"Having other people tell You it's fine and give You their insight on the matter really helps, though try not to overuse it or at least not to vent to the same person all the time, otherwise You will become toxic towards that person as they will have to deal not only with their problems but with Yours too. Approaching them sometimes is fine but drowning them in Your problems or only talking to them to vent is not good. So talk with multiple people instead of just one, internet is a great tool for that! Third thing I do is distract myself.","Looks like the depression and disappointment hit me post midnight, as Im currently up at 5 am typing this. You know when only *one* small thing goes wrong then suddenly youre all up in a rut about every life decision youve made? Well, Im feeling really shitty about the fact that technically I allowed two things of my own possession to get slightly damaged, all in one night. Due to being lazy in bed, I asked my dad to shake my lava lamp to let the floating hardened liquid to sink towards the bottom. He shook it too hard, causing the whole thing to fall apart and for the lightbulb to lose one of its connector pieces. He said hed go to the hardware store soon to replace the lightbulb, but Im in slight doubt if the lamp will work after that, feeling that its my fault, in technical aspects. If I had simply gotten up to do it myself, then my lamp would have been fine. This is going to also sound ridiculous, but my new phone (no case, no screen protector) somehow slid off the surface I placed it on while doing something this late at night, causing it to hit the hard floor screen first, getting itself some small scratches on its corners in the process. I know the scratches arent that bad, but my obsessive compulsive disorder really tests my tolerance when it comes to the smallest things. And it was a new phone that Ive only had for a couple of weeks, for crying out loud! Why couldnt I have placed it on the floor or on the counter instead? Ive just been self deprecating for the past two hours, so far.In sum from all of this, how do I effectively diminish the thought of I could have done this to prevent this or that so I can learn from these small situations that have been bothering me for the past couple of hours? I guess I somehow have a compass as to how I can solve this, but hearing something from somebody else would really encourage me."

"hello, fellow Canadian here. Close to Toronto. I can understand how frustrating this is for you and I am sorry you are going through this alone. I am not in a similar position but I am sure there are lots of people in the same position as you. You are right about the current state of the systems here in Canada, the minimum wage workers can not afford to live and this entire country is car dependent. And yes Covid is reeking havoc on mental health all over the world. It is hard, really hardAll I can say is that ""this too shall pass"" That is a quote from a Buddhist monk. So right now everything sucks and you are suffering but it will (eventually) pass and you will start to see the light againKeep pushing and looking for new ways to make life better, I know it hard but that is all we can do &lt;3","Long post,I suffer from neurological and mental disorders and have always had trouble keeping work. I'm in an affordable city ( Montreal ) but really want to go, but everywhere I look it all seems even more expensive than it was.Toronto is not doable, Hamilton has gone up a lot too. I could really only afford a shared apartment on minimum wage ( if I could keep the job ) and disability isn't enough for a 1 bedroom either. Living with others can be very stressful, of course not as stressful as being homeless, I know I was once for a short time.I just feel so depressed being poor and mentally ill in Canada, like the raising rent and costs of food, ect makes it no longer a place for poor people, minimum wage workers. I'm just alone in this big city, no license, no job, and the Covid19 situation makes it hard for me to connect to communities, to feel like I have a future. There are only a few places left that are affordable for low income people in Canada, and those places have high unemployment and are car dependent.

I desperately want to communicate this issue but she can already read it off of me (been together for a long time) which is making her mental health worse at times, and I think if we were to outright have that conversation it would cause her mental health to be even worse.

"Its a tough age. I went through the same exact thingacne on my face, my chest, my shoulders, my back..... I had few friends, felt like no one would ever love me, got picked on and bullied a bit. Middle school was the worst schooling years of my life. Things got a little bit better in high school.

"Sounds like this is a learning experience on multiple levels.=/  It's normal to feel a little out of your depth at an internship: lots to pick up, and people aren't always understanding or kind about it. If there's any silver lining to the situation: an internship is temporary. Anything you learn and experience there will help you in your job later.(I know that may seem like an unfeeling or an intellectual response, but honestly true.) Not just school/employment skills, but also how people treat each other on the job. Social intelligence, you know? Some day, when you're the boss, you'll remember what it was like to be the intern.Without knowing too many of the particulars of your job, it's hard to say what to expect.","It is now week 3 of my first ever internship and every day I come home feeling worse about myself and how things are going. I try to ask questions but a lot of times I feel like Im so confused I dont know where to start or my manager is not there and i dont even know who to go to for questions. When he is there and I ask questions he always seems to answer in a way that makes me feel stupid and like I should have just figured out the answer on my own. I am currently working on 3 projects and a couple side projects for my managers boss. Not sure if that is normal or not but I am feeling very  overwhelmed and anxious. Im just tired of coming back to my apartment everyday feeling like Ive accomplished nothing again, I am constantly wondering why I was hired for this position when I know so many others that would probably do better. I just want to feel like I did something right at work : ( "
"I am not the type that likes to be jokingly teased. But when it happens on a group it leaves us feeling vulnerable. The best thing to do is deal it back to him. Or even talking him one on one.

This server also has their friends, and one of them is a jerk. I was just in a huge argument with him. He instigated it and insulted me a lot more then I did him. In the discord we tried to make it like a democracy. Then this guy came and ruined it. He has no respect and really just a sucky guy. I can tell his parents are either overwhelmed with a lot of kids or their bad people. He clearly doesnt get the support he needs and hes a bully. I just left the discord and Im trying to get some of my friends to join my new one but only one has joined and he says he might not stay for long.

"I'm not even apart of this sub. I was looking for a sub to post some encouragement to. During times like this, it's important to remember the good that you DO have. Where there is hard times, there is always hope. This season of life can be particularly tough for someone in your situation. It's especially important during these times to respect yourself and not chase worthless love. Love is a beautiful thing, but not in the context of hook ups. Hook up culture will never fail to tear you down. It's short term happiness over long term joy. Typically the short term happiness leads to long term misery. Hang in there. Things **will** pick up. Hang in there :). Whether you believe or not, I will be praying for you!","My dream job got shut down, I can't go to school to take classes in person for my extremely hands-on major, and my backup job at a barbershop has been closed down now too. Aside from occasionally seeing my friends (which I know I shouldn't be doing in the first place) there's not much that makes me feel whole. I waste my time on dating apps and hooking up with people who don't care about me and it's negatively affecting my self image. At the beginning of the year I felt like I could take on the whole world. Right now all I want to do is cry in bed."

"It cuts you down when people sneer, smirk, joke, bully, make fun of, etc... at you and it is hurtful. Yes, completely! But, the thing is, honestly, those people are hurting just as much (if not more) and are just better at hiding it. More often than not, they are more damaged than you are. I certainly dont say this to provide the impression that you should feel better than them because they are actually worse off, but know that they are no better than you because they are skinny, pretty, etc.. They, too, struggle. Everyone fights a battle that you know nothing about.Its not until you are much older that you realize how kind you need to treat one another. No one wins or improves by cutting each other down.Its hard, but you have to find self-worth and confidence in yourself.","I have a part-time retail job which admittedly I love, mostly because of an awesome manager. But it's not enough to live on, so I'm planning to get some electrician training. There's always a market for that, they're unionized, and I love working with my hands. So far, so good. I've located a technical college that:\- is less than half an hour from my house (\*super convenient\*)\- has a six-month certificate program (\*not so short that it feels incomplete, not so long that I get frustrated\*)\- offers job placement assistance after graduation (\*SCORE!\*)\- classes start at 7:45 AM (\*record scratch sound effect...\*)Oh dear. There's a reason I work the evening shift. I know this is a petty thing to get hung up on in the face of such an otherwise-perfect opportunity, but it's been a VERY long time since I've been required to get up early on a regular basis. And now I'm on medication with a side effect of insomnia. My current situation is unsustainable, and these early classes will allow me to stick with my usual evening shift; but I have a long history of being easily discouraged and can already feel myself backpedaling. I need someone to talk me out of talking myself out of this."

Which has been great because I haven't managed to read a book in almost a decade. Not to mention having to make the time to listen to an audiobook given how crammed my schedule is, since I also do my best to make time to spend with my girlfriend. It's also really nice to know that my girlfriend and I are in this together.I'm just trying to remind myself how far I have come, and how I'm right on the cusp of the rest of my life.

"I can relate. I took almost 8 years off before going back last September to finish my undergraduate degree in philosophy. I'll be done in April. I left a full time job and took out a loan and it's terrifying.The thing is - like you said - you didn't come to this decision lightly. Nothing in life is guaranteed, so honestly you might graduate and worst case scenario you don't have the job of your dreams lined up. Shit happens. When you graduate, and whether you do is 100% in your control, you will have so many more opportunities to pursue, be it more education or maybe you'll be inspired by something along the way. You'll also have the pride of knowing you went back to school and you have letters to write beside your name!","I've been away from school for a few years dealing with personal things and now I'm finally deciding to go back. I have a lot of doubts and insecurities about how much money I'm spending on a degree that might not actually do me any good, especially since I took a few years off from getting it. But this is not a decision I'm making lightly, and it's one I've spent many many nights thinking about. It seems every time I bring up these fears with people they advise me to keep waiting until I'm sure, or to think about getting a different degree. They love me and are trying to support me, but I think they miss the point... and I've only felt worse since I began making these fears known. To clarify I'm going back for a science BA in geology, a passion of mine. Any sort of words of positivity or encouragement would go a long way for me. I try my best to be an optimist, but lately I feel very pessimistic about this very big deal in my life that I was originally looking so forward to. "

Not only that, but he took Calc II that same semester ( he needed to graduate or they would kick him out ) and he got an A in that! It shows 2 things.

An opportunity to find yourself and know who you are and keeping up with that good eating habit,"I'm in a very strange period right now and I'm still trying to figure it out, but I'll try to describe it the best I can. Events in chronological order:During the quarantine, I took the time to workout and eat better. I had the discipline and the determination to lose weight and get fitter.Since June, work has been stressful, because of upcoming deadlines. I got me in a procrastination-due-to-anxiety state. My work isn't great, but it's not terrible either. I'm planning on getting at least decent results before July.This weekend, we got very bad news in the family.Since then, I feel like I want to lose control of my life. A small and easy way to do it was to completely wreck my quarantine habits. I've been eating like an absolute mess and haven't worked-out at all for the last few days. I also haven't touched my musical instruments, which I normally practice pretty much every day. Everything is less fun, less interesting, less joyful, etc. I can be distracted for a while, but my energy level and general happiness is much lower than usual.

My past self says that she hopes that I am just as inspired as she is at the moment and hopes I am getting enough rest and she is very proud of me.

I desperately want to communicate this issue but she can already read it off of me (been together for a long time) which is making her mental health worse at times, and I think if we were to outright have that conversation it would cause her mental health to be even worse.

So my friend and I have known each for a long time and my friend lives across the country hes the same age as me and overreacts at everything when we talk and play with each other I say something offensive that was meant to be a joke he takes it seriously and now because I was being insecure about who I really am he cant trust me I share almost everything with him but...now Im not sure if he wants to stay friends..I care deeply about my friend and would never want to hurt him but i dont know what to do anymore and thats not even Half the shit I feel Im 14 years old and I have had anxiety attacks on and off day in and day out my family isnt that great and I keep everything from them even tho I shouldnt but when I do try to open up they try to help but instead make it worse I dont shit.i know people think that Im just a little girl and know nothing about life or love or pain but Im hurt and I have no one else to talk to...I came here because I needed to rant but looking back on these things that I say I feel worthless and Pitiful and ashamed...I used to cut my thighs thinking it was going to make me feel better and it did for a while but then it didnt and I started cutting harder and deeper making myself bleed and my thighs werent enough so I cut my wrists and told myself to hide them one day I was so depressed and felt almost nothing emotionally that I tried planning my death and when I was going to do it.

"Don't just quit bud! I think you have the passion and drive to become a personal trainer. It may be that a corporate gym might not be the best setting to start off given that it's such a small clientele, and you wouldn't be getting as much experience. It's good to be at a bigger place where clients are being pooled by the trainers. You got this!!!","First time poster, could really use a pick me up.Heres the full story. Wall of text incoming, but theres a tldr at the end. Out of college I got hired to do social media for a political lobbyist group. I won't say which one because I don't want to start anything, that's not what this is about. The point is it paid well enough. At age 22 I was making 36k a year. But I was miserable. The morals were questionable, the workload was soul crushing, and the hours were unappreciated. Not to mention my bosses were all crazy homophobic.But I found my passion in fitness while I was there. No matter how bad my day at work was I could go to the gym and lift it out, get it out of my system, feel good and accomplished about something.So after a year and a half at that job, I got my personal training certification. And I quit suddenly."
"Hey, you can absolutely do this! I actually moved to NYC at 24 and it was definitely scary. But if youre starting a degree you will have no problem making friends. And the city is full of people like you with big dreams. Youll fit right in! Plus its less scary once you get there.","I want to move to NYC next year and start my degree as an FNP, but Im scared. What if I dont make friends? Those first few months might be really lonely especially in the fall. At the same time Im 26 years old and have dreamed of living in NYC since I was 13. I never really had the college experience when I got my bachelors, I didnt make that many friends, even though Im a social person. Im worried I cant do it and that Im not good enough.

"Hey friend. I know this is a day late, but I just wanted to tell you Im sorry for your loss and hardship. I hope things get better for you.If I may make a suggestion, I would recommend therapy.

That is a step in the right direction and Im really glad you found people to help you. I am also glad you are trying the growth mindset.If I could make a suggestion, I would recommend finding a tutor for help if you are struggling with the material.

"Im not sure if this the place to recommend this, but today my counselor was talking about acceptance and commitment therapy. I just started with this today, so I dont know how effective it is (for me at least; like most things its different for everyone) but I say its worth trying. Recognize that youll have those bad moments and bad days, and embrace the fact that nothing is ever perfect. Take note of the times when things are good, and reflect on those when youre not doing as well. Hope all is well for you soon","I need some help. I'm having a lot of trouble mentally and don't want to burden friends and family with my issues. I don't want to burden anyone really. But I guess strangers are better in this scenario. Lately, I don't want to be here anymore. I don't necessarily want to kill myself persay just not exist. I'm feeling like a complete failure and that the world would be better off if I wasn't in it. I'm not remarkable. I'm not going to change the world (although that's what I thought I was suppose to do). At best I will live an average normal existence. I hate that in order to even remotely be alright I have to take medication for the rest of my life. Anxiety and depression overwhelm my life. It's been going on to varying degrees now for the last 20 years.  I've been everywhere from comatose on antianxieties to agoraphobic to disgusting because I can't even handle basic hygiene. Sometimes, every so often, I am actually happy. I think. But the demons always come back. I'm so tired of living this way. It effects every facet of my live. I've lost jobs, friends, relationships etc. It seems the only way to keep the demons away is to just cease to be here.  I've had another fairly bad episode this past week and I'm worried about my job. I'm worried about what my coworkers think. I'm worried about pretty much everything to be honest. The list is endless. I guess what I'm asking is for some comforting words of encouragement that everything won't implode and even if it does it won't always be that way."
Amen! Im glad your focus shifted towards Christ. This pandemic is certainly happening for all people to come to Christ and gain a deep relationship with Him and know how much we NEED Him. Just as your focus has shifted towards Christ so has my focus as well and it started somewhere in 2018 while I was attending medical school and had a part time job.,"And just when the company was supposed to call me for joining, Covid happened. Hope diminished, Loan EMI still going on which my father pays, lost out on peace. Its then I began to ponder on my identity and what I relied on. And I found the answer in a verse from bible, Romans 8:28~ and we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose The responsibility I have is to shift my identity and put it in God, because God is permanent. When I put my identity , of who I am in something permanent thats when there is no fear of losing peace, thats when I have nothing to be anxious of. Doesnt it answer our fundamental question. We lose so much of our lives in giving and focusing on temporary needs and dont realise the grave danger of losing out on hope. I found the answer in this Covid 19 situation and somehow Im grateful that I realised it. Im regaining my peace during the madness around me and I want to leave you with this exhortation to shift your identity to Jesus. Because all it took was a pandemic to shift mine in something permanent.."
"When I was a sophomore in high school I completely broke down in the guidance counselors office to a random counselor (my assigned one wasnt there that day) and she really helped me, she became my advocate for letting me drop 3 extremely stressful AP courses in the middle of the year to give me a better chance at success in regular level classes.

I have had precious items sold from under my nose by family.....I&amp;nbsp;&gt;once had a $100 electoric guitar and $50 amp bought for christmas one year....I didn't even have that for a year. I went to school one day came back and it was gone. My older brother walks in and said he had to sell my guitar and amp to help pay for his rent which was a joke cause he was doing drugs at the time.,"So...Today I was planning on giving myself a pizza birthday with anyone who wanted to join on my campus. I only have two friends. I got a check for $100 yesterday that I cashed and I have been looking forward to this all week. Even after my birthday that happened this past Wednesday. I had some bills to pay like hulu and neflix which I didn't mind. But i made sure that I was saving enough to I could buy the stuff. I got on the bus. Got some drinks for myself and I got two bracelets from hot topic too but what I didn't realize was that most of my billing stuff happened today. So I went from $60 to $8 cause I didn't know my netflix bill and hulu bill happened today. So after I bought drinks and two cool bracelets for myself, I didn't have enough money to buy my pizzas. I was at target and I had put two digornio's stuffed cheese pizzas in my cart and I was trying to check my bank finances cause I always get paranoid that money is going to disappear. But I had $40 after I bought my bracelets."

But today's email tells me that all of my accounts are being deactivated to ""save money"" and that he hopes the team can get up and functional again in January and he hopes I'll be part of the team then.So I'm essentially now unemployed for all of December which means Christmas is going to suck even more than usual, and I'm probably going to spend the next couple of weeks struggling with the heavier bouts of depression and anxiety again.I've been applying for jobs both remote and local for two months now and I haven't gotten anything, no bites at all.

"You were not born to kill yourself, if these are the thoughts you are having,the thing that you need to realize is that just because a bird(thought) flys over your head does not mean you have to create a nest for it to reside.

"Remember that when going through a break up, it amplifies feelings of insecurity and rejection. These things do not define u. They are just the current ""glasses"" u are seeing the world through. Learn about yourself and what makes u happy and whole without it relying on others and their approval or acceptances. It takes all kinds of people to make the world. You are unique and wonderful in ur own unique wonderful ways. If you can learn what makes u happy, you can strengthen that, like a muscle and rely on that more than others and their validation.","Going through a tough time in my life. 37F.

"Hey, if you go a bit early see if you can find a court support worker to sit with you. I used to be one and would sit with any woman filing for an intervention order against a partner that wanted me to, and I would sit in a way that meant they didnt have to look at the person or see their face, (there were support workers for men filing for orders too) bring a photo of a loved one or memory that makes you smile and whilst theyre saying their piece you can have a moment and take your mind somewhere else by looking at the photo, also remember 5-5-5 breathing if you get anxious, breath in for 5 counts, hold it for 5 counts, exhale for 5 counts. This forces you to slow down, not take in too much oxygen and hyperventilate.","Just need a little encouragement. A man threatened suicide when I told him I no longer wanted to date. I helped him get help and when I thought the situation deescalated, I left. He since has sent numerous texts and emails. Finally, he sent a 4-page letter to my house claiming that I caused all of the anxiety, depression, and desire to end it all. I filed a PFA (protection from abuse) against him. He is an abuser and its going to take a lot to be in the same room as him tomorrow - and to listen to him make up his version of reality, and to fight the protection I am seeking.I am hoping against hope that the judge believes me and is willing to grant this order to give me some peace of mind."
"Ignore them. I truly believe everyone at the gym at first thinks all eyes are on them. Push through the uncomfortable and turn the other cheek. Crank your favorite song and zone the world out!

Just today I was at the gym not 10 minutes ago and a couple of super skinny super hot girls just snickered at me. Part of it's probably because I'm paranoid but I feel like they were saying look at the fat girl trying to be like us Jesus Christ she doesn't f****** belong here. And so I ran home.

I'm just to anxiety-ridden and depressed to not go to the gym but at the same time when it's making those symptoms worse... I don't know I just need some encouragement."
"Go and make those cannolis, brother! The fact that you made them from scratch will tell her that you cared enough. You put time and effort into this plan. She'll know you care for her, that you would go through thick and thin for this girl. ","Some background: I work inventory for a website that sells trading cards, and I've been mildly crushing on a coworker for awhile now. She's nice, funny, quiet, shy, cute, and from the little bit we've interacted she seems like an interesting person. We haven't interacted much outside of passing conversation because I'm also a pretty quiet and shy person, so the few times I've had the chance I've never been able to think of a way to interact with her without it seeming very forced or making it awkward for one or both of us. The crush level has gone up recently because she got me a cheesecake platter for my birthday. Not an unusual thing as she's always bringing in cookies for everyone but it made my day all the same. I've got the chance to return the favor, but it's not under quite the best of circumstances; She's got a surgery scheduled for this week, and while it's not major she's said she's still really scared (Can't blame her). Add in her having a bout of the flu and she's been in a pretty bad place the last few weeks.I decided to get her something to cheer her up and settled on making her cannoli (I saw from a FB post of hers that she liked it) and spent the last few days carefully finding out her favorite flavors and any food allergies she may have without directly asking her."

"First off, do what u/bookluvre said. However, if you can't find an online version of this school, just go for it. It will take a while but eventually you'll get used to getting up early in the morning. In the passing time when you're still dreading to get up, just make sure to drink coffee and do some kind of workout, whether it be taking a run or jog for a bit or doing jumping jacks.

I've located a technical college that:\- is less than half an hour from my house (\*super convenient\*)\- has a six-month certificate program (\*not so short that it feels incomplete, not so long that I get frustrated\*)\- offers job placement assistance after graduation (\*SCORE!\*)\- classes start at 7:45 AM (\*record scratch sound effect...\*)Oh dear.

And now I'm on medication with a side effect of insomnia.

I havent done the homework yet, and I know that this isn't the way to go, i should havd done homework first to guage how well i know the material before stressing.  But I've had this mental block all day, and just this mental block in general that I can't actually be confident in my math skills.  And i always have this self doubt.  I just have thus idea that I can never be smart in all things math, I'm trying to have a growth mindset but its so hard.  I know that i have to put the work in to understanding math, and im going to try, but right after im done crying.  I just needed to say it as a stranger online since i don't have anyone to tell in real life, i dont want to put this all on my friends because I did that last night. And if im like this during the first year how will i handle the rest?During the summer i had the expectation that i would do better this year, but in already drained, I dont want to go throug mh 4 years of this.  If anyone has any advice, or comforting words or experience they could share, that would be nice."
"Ok I want to recommend some things: Try taking care of your body. Go eat some food, drink water, take a shower, take your meds. It's important. If you're looking for a reason to live, try the suicide hotline. At least try it before you do anything serious. It's what it's there for, and anyone you talk to would for sure have better advice than I would. If you're looking for unconditional love, all I can say is that the only unconditional love I've ever found came from Jesus. Best decision I ever made was to accept it. The future is not hopeless and you are not worthless.","I met her very young daughter and fell in love with them even more quickly. She told me she loved me and wanted a future with me. We promised that if it wasnt working out we would tell each other and not just ghost the other, we did a pinky swear that we would not breakup over text, that we would not ghost each other as it had happened to us both, we would show each other the love we feel in that moment as a promise.We did OK for the few weeks after she was laid off and we couldnt go out as much. I tried to help with as much money as I could, but as the weeks progressed I started to feel like an ATM again, she stopped texting, she stopped calling, only when it was time for me to give money would she come back, now we have slowly drifted apart more she didn't come back last week when i got paid. And now I dont feel anything is left. She has been distant for a long time now, not texting or answering calls. She only said she has shit going on but nothing more. She doesnt say I love you anymore, she doesnt even say hi or I miss you. It is as if I dreamed her and I am waking up from that dream again, and she was never real.I feel that I have been just dropped yet again, but this time I let my heart believe it was different."
"I went through a bad break up just like this a few years ago. At the time I thought, exactly as you do, that I lost the person I was meant to be with the rest of my life.I couldn't have been more wrong. She grew into a person very different from who I want to be with, and now I am with a new partner who I really AM meant to be with, who makes me so happy in a way I never even dreamed with my previous girlfriend.You will get through this and it WILL get better. I know that's hard to hear, but actually one of the cures for a broken heart (as I discovered) is having a positive vision for the future not a negative one of clinging onto the past. I clung on for years. But I didn't need to, because the future was better than I ever imagined",Im going through a bad break up with the person I thought I was going to spend the rest of my life with. I feel like I always get thrown away like trash even when I love a person with all of my heart. I just need a reminder that there are good people out there. Im not ready for another relationship of course but honestly Im scared Ill always get hurt. I hate feeling like that. I really thought he was different.Any stories of success right now will make me happy. I love hearing about happy people and happy couples. I just need to know that love can be real.

"I hear parenthood refocuses a person's priorities and perspective on life.  The realization that a new human being -- their well-being, education, role-models, their entire future! -- depends on you *should* be a life-changing experience.  Unfortunately, many parents seem unable to put their children first.  Self-worship is a lonely religion.  Children and society at large suffer because of it. You're doing the right thing to focus on being a good mother to your son.  IMO, you deserve a partner who is dedicated to being a good dad, not just a father.  My heart hurts to see your suffering.Keep fighting these battles.  It's totally worth it.  Your son will be a better person because of your love and dedication.  Be well! &lt;3","Arguing with me over not answering his phone calls when he thought I should, questioning my whereabouts and who I was hanging out with, and arguing with me about how I was disrespectful to him because I made a sarcastic joke or telling me that my facial expressions and tone of voice was disrespecting him, he would blow this out of proportion and make it seem like I'm antagonizing him, when I was just responding to a question he was asking. I asked him how was my tone and he couldn't tell me.&amp;#x200B;The recent dispute happened when I told him he could not have $1000 from my refund check. I did tell him yes earlier in the month, but after thinking and reconsidering his actions and everything that I have endured like paying for daycare for the past 3 months, and finding out he was going to party instead of working like he told me, I decided that I was not handing over any money to him. I cautioned myself and explained to him, I can't give the $1000 because I do not have means to do so right now. He went ballistic and basically told me that I put him in debt by throwing him in jail and after all the things he has done for me--I can't help him out. He goes on and says, you've been holding out on me and you weren't going to give me the money anyways. Then he tells me we should just take care of our son. I snap and say- that's fine, I don't want to be with you anymore while were at it."
"You may or may not be a Christian, but these are two verses that might help you. Matthew 6:34""Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own""AndMatthew 5:25""Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes?""Now again, even if you aren't a Christian this is how I would respond:Are you going to be ok? Yes you will, but it depends on what you consider ""ok"". Worrying about how much you will make is honestly just not worth it.","My wife and I recently moved to be closer to her family to help with childcare. I was making $40,000+/yr at a restaurant.  I've worked in restaurants most of my life and have truly come to hate it. So with the move, I decided to try to do something different.  So I got a job in a completely different industry and now only make $15.50/ hr, about $30,000/yr. My wife just got a job making $13/hr.  I'm struggling seeing us making enough money to obtain our goals. We are currently living with her parents. We have two kids and the oldest will be starting preschool in a year or two. We still need to get another car for myself that's big enough for all four of us.  And we really want to start thinking about buying our first house instead of renting. Are we going to be OK? Can someone just call me crazy and say it's going to work out?My wife's reaction was to start yelling that this is why she hates being with me.  Nothing is ever good enough for me and I'm incredibly hard on my self because I want to be and to give my kids everything I didn't have.  And I don't think I'll be able to with only $15/ hr."

I die more each time I wake up from that dream life; the pain gets worse; my chest physically hurts right now as I am so heartbroken.I could live with her telling me its not working and she is breaking up with me, that would hurt but its the unknown, the not knowing for sure that she doesnt want me and the why. But I know logically silence is an answer, but how can someone say they love you then be so mean and just drop you from their life, that is not love.I would give anything I have to be held right now, just to be held, to feel wanted, to feel loved, and maybe even be together and remember what being alive means. I am going to try to sleep for a while, I am so tired, maybe my heart will just stop while I sleep and the pain of waking up wont happen, I can only wish it would happen. Can someone really die like that from heartbreak? I only wish it would happen. So tired of everything right now."
"Hey, as someone who has been both a student and an instructor at the collegiate level during the pandemic, I just wanted to let you know that this happens to a LOT of people, and it is not a big deal. We all read stuff wrong, miss classes, and guess what: you are still on a good track and you're doing fine. Also, give yourself grace -- we are living through really stressful times! You have a lot on your shoulders, and things are harder than normal! That says a lot about your strength and your ability to move forward and be successful. If you didn't care, you wouldn't be worried at all, and it's cool that you do care and you want to get it right. That's a major strength of yours. Just don't let it beat you up!

Did I mention I feel like such an idiot? UUGHGHGHH I want to disappear into thin air right now and forget about all this. It might be weird next week when I show up out of nowhere without having been there for the first session. Well, hopefully I can email my professor and hope and pray I don't get kicked out or something. Please encourage me; I'm really feeling down right now, also because I know my parents will not be too happy with me."

I helped him get help and when I thought the situation deescalated, I left. He since has sent numerous texts and emails. Finally (much, much later when I thought this was over) he sent a 4-page letter to my house claiming that I caused all of the anxiety, depression, and desire to end it all. I filed a PFA (protection from abuse) against him. He is an abuser and its going to take a lot to be in the same room as him tomorrow - and to listen to him make up his version of reality, and to fight the protection I am seeking.I am hoping against hope that the judge believes me and is willing to grant this order to give me some peace of mind.UPDATE: abuser tried to outright lie and say I kept coming to his building so HE now wanted an order against ME. My incredible lawyer was not having any of that - and I was granted the order. Thank you everyone for your encouragement. I am so relieved"

Every cosplayer I know that creates great things has a backlog of less than ideal pieces and a whole truckload of stories about stupid/expensive/""mate i dont even know how it happened"" mistakes. While some people can be mean just because they can, the cosplay community itself is super encouraging and if you're stuck with how to improve something someone has an answer for you on a trick to do it!","So. Im a near-first-time cosplayer, and Im not very confident in myself. For reference, Im in middle school (Almost done!), so confidence doesnt necessarily come easily. My sister and her entire friend group cosplay a bunch and sometimes, when I look at their cosplays, I think theyre way better than mine ever could be, even though I know theyre older and more experienced. Im actually in my Tanjiro cosplay right now, and I want to post it to /r/cosplay, but Im really scared someone will diss me because its not good or I dont have contacts or something.

So many thoughts of experience and wisdom i just dont know where to start. First you are not the reason for being alone. If your friends jumped ship that quick and didnt take the time to know your side of the story then they arent your friends. A true friend will not leave you during the messed up times. For example my best friend made a dumb mistake and got 30 days in jail. Most of her family and friends who knew about it made her feel like a loser and not a good person. My best friend is an amazing person. She has a heart bigger then mine and mine is the size of texas. She made a bad choice in a weak moment. So i would ask again were they really your friends?,"She was leading me on for a month and a half and I thought I was really getting somewhere. The fact that she tried to feel that way for me and couldnt made everything worse. I know this may sound irrational but I cant help feel that there is something wrong with me and that Im screwed up and thats why this happened to me. Every time I put myself out there I get hurt and this one was a huge blow to the gut. On top of all this, I had a falling out with one of my best friends and he turned some of my other friends against me. I just cant help but feel like everything bad that happens in my life is a direct result of my actions. I had no reason to think that the girl I was talking to would have liked me in the first place. We were barely friends before but after I asked for her number we got really close. She said the reason she doesnt want to make our relationship anything more is because she doesnt want to destroy the relationship we have right now. I dont know how true that actually is. I want to be friends with her but I dont know if she honestly values our friendship or if that is just a load of crap to make me feel better. I feel like Im a failure and I feel like I hurt everyone I'm involved with. If youve read all of this I appreciate it and any advice is appreciated"
How bout me?,Just wanted to say that :) You're the best!
"I agree with others that you should definitely talk to your doctor. However, you are so inspiring!!! Keep doing you! You can accomplish everything you want to and more. And remember that failure is your friend :) there will be struggles along the way but you WILL overcome them. Go get that education. Knowledge is power.","I have a part-time retail job which admittedly I love, mostly because of an awesome manager. But it's not enough to live on, so I'm planning to get some electrician training. There's always a market for that, they're unionized, and I love working with my hands. So far, so good. I've located a technical college that:\- is less than half an hour from my house (\*super convenient\*)\- has a six-month certificate program (\*not so short that it feels incomplete, not so long that I get frustrated\*)\- offers job placement assistance after graduation (\*SCORE!\*)\- classes start at 7:45 AM (\*record scratch sound effect...\*)Oh dear. There's a reason I work the evening shift. I know this is a petty thing to get hung up on in the face of such an otherwise-perfect opportunity, but it's been a VERY long time since I've been required to get up early on a regular basis. And now I'm on medication with a side effect of insomnia. My current situation is unsustainable, and these early classes will allow me to stick with my usual evening shift; but I have a long history of being easily discouraged and can already feel myself backpedaling. I need someone to talk me out of talking myself out of this."
"They were frustrated with the overall poor experience, they didnt learn much and wanted to leave. But, they would still fill out the feedback forms that it was a great company, that theyd return again and that they appreciated all of the learning opportunities. My voice in the displeasure of the entire program was never understood. The company was such a large company that my voice was barely even a whisper.Im sorry you are having to experience this. It sounds as though you may have on-boarded with a similar company (that I ended up resigning from for similar reasons).","It is now week 3 of my first ever internship and every day I come home feeling worse about myself and how things are going. I try to ask questions but a lot of times I feel like Im so confused I dont know where to start or my manager is not there and i dont even know who to go to for questions. When he is there and I ask questions he always seems to answer in a way that makes me feel stupid and like I should have just figured out the answer on my own.

Its best not to get into an argument and never to start one. Whatever someones says just leave it to them. I wouldnt think too much about your friends. If its time to separate then its time. A real heart of a friend would stay through the right and the wrong.,"I joined a discord server awhile ago that has a couple of my friends. This server also has their friends, and one of them is a jerk. I was just in a huge argument with him. He instigated it and insulted me a lot more then I did him. In the discord we tried to make it like a democracy. Then this guy came and ruined it. He has no respect and really just a sucky guy. I can tell his parents are either overwhelmed with a lot of kids or their bad people. He clearly doesnt get the support he needs and hes a bully. I just left the discord and Im trying to get some of my friends to join my new one but only one has joined and he says he might not stay for long. I really need some encouragement right now, so Im asking a bunch of internet strangers. P.s. taking a walk to cool down hopefully it makes me feel better.Update: one of my friends was trying to force us to talk before I was ready. After a bit I got to stop.

My only real choice here is to stand up and do it.Can anyone please give me the encouragement to call back and try again next week? I really need it."
It's possible to get a brief perverse pleasure out if pulling others down. But what people don't realize is that comes back to hurt you. It mentally creates a negativity that will in the future make you miserable. Karma is definitely real on the mental level - hurting others hurts your mind and helping them helps your mind. People just need to see that and then they'll be good. ,"I just realized something discouraging.  r/RoastMe and other forums dedicated to negativity are freakin' massive (1.2M?!).  Disproportionately large compared to r/encouragement or whatever is trending the opposite way.Is it more difficult to do good in this world?  Especially because suffering is a real problem that most people seem content to ignore.I don't care, how difficult it is though.  I like helping people.  Do you?"
"For me, conquering college was all about time management. Let me repeat that: TIME MANAGEMENT. If you can organize wtf needs to be done, and make the time and space for it to get done, you can master college. Make a routine of studying. After class ends, don't go home, go to the library and make yourself put in another hour or two of studying. A lot of people got through high school never studying.","In the past week alone, Ive gotten two 45s on quizzes and i feel like everything is crashing around me. Im not even doing poorly really (all As and a B) but my peers are doing better than I am and dont hesitate to tell me that. I dont want to do worse than I am, and honestly I cant afford it. I dont even know what im doing, and everything is just too much."
"And if you fail from time to time, like humans are known to do, that's okay, just keep going and trying again until it gets easier and you can move on to whatever is next. I'd also encourage you to rest and take care of yourself. If that means getting up early to do a hobby before work, or read a book at night, or something that you enjoy, just try to do that for you. You have value too, I promise. Lastly, I'd definitely encourage you to continue to pursue someplace to go for your mental health. I assure you that there are those who care and want to help you, that's why they're there. It'll be good for you to come together with others and work on your health.","Blood everywhere. Its left a couple scars. Im lucky Im not blind.I dont want to tell you the whole story it would take a long time to recount all the details and a lot of it was just madness.

The police came, and I was delirious but not combative, since I had collapsed. During the ambulance ride and for several hours afterwards I was hearing voices. My legs and arms were cuffed to a bed for the entire night. They position you in a certain uncomfortable position so you cant reach your hands close enough together to grab/use anything.

"Friend, I've been there.  My PhD was a total grind at times, and it took me about a year longer than the department average to finish.  I'm sorry that you felt like you needed to give up so much for this exam.  I think you're going to do great!!  And then imagine the fun things you will be able to do after Tuesday! :)  No matter what happens, you're going to be OK","I've been doing nothing but studying all summer for my last qualifying exam next Tuesday. I had no one to help me. I gave up alcohol and pot because I didn't want to tarnish my memory in any way. I love the outdoors in the summer, but with studying I've had little time for it.So basically I've given everything I love up for an entire summer and dedicated all my energy toward passing this test. I wanted to review this week, but I feel like I have nothing left to give and I'm impatient to get back to the things I love. I've had panic attacks all day.I need some support to help get me through these last overwhelming couple of days.Thanks for reading this."

I've never worked in a bank before so I don't know how strict they are about these types of mistakes. But it seems to me that it was purely an honest mistake and a learning opportunity. I hope they can see that and give you a second chance. Don't beat yourself up about a mistake though. It's not a life and death mistake and it's not worth stressing too much over.

When I failed to get married in my 20s, and now am in my almost mid 30s, I am considered a failure by my religious family. It doesnt matter that Ive moved alone, found a job to support myself, had to learn absolutely everything on my own.  My mom doesnt care and wonders why I wont just settle for a guy who will make money. That guy has never come along and I didnt have the option of being homeless and jobless.Yesterday I finally researched in detail about ux (user interaction) design. I finally learned about the process and how I could start this path.For the first time this year I have felt hopeful. Its been such a bad year, so many horrible things happened. I had a legit near death experience a few months ago and had to deal with legal research and consequences of that.For the first time I feel hopeful even though Im alone and have no one to be happy for me."
"My parents used to take my brother and I on family walks to try and get extra movement in, sometimes with the whole family, other times just one of them with one of us and so on depending on what was going on.I dont have kids, but my mum was a single parent for ages and part of how she managed to make sure we stayed eating healthy was to take time to plan the weekly grocery shop based on what she planned to cook for dinner during the week.(She was also a ""surgical strike"" shopper so would zip through the grocery store only buying what was on her list to save time/money.) If you want I can give you a list of my family's general go to recipes/meals since most of it is fairly simple to make - I started cooking dinner regularly around 14 to help out. I'm not a nutrition or health professional, but I'm fairly sure that diet and calories consumed is a more effective way of managing weight than exercise - but of course there are mental and physical health benefits with exercise.","I recently got married, then my wife and I decided to foster, then we moved. All within a year and a half. We both use to be so active almost every day. I understand parenting is a priority but with this current child we literally cannot get out of the house.

Now she is lucky to do yoga twice a month and I might get 30 minutes each week to run or ride. I'm kinda depressed, anxious about getting fat and catch myself slipping on my healthy foods. Wife feels the same. Im honestly just thinking about accepting my fate, buying larger clothes and just letting go. I dont want it but that's what seems to be happening."

Of note I'm married with a 6 moth old daughter.Well...I showed up to my first calculus test (I originally passed it with an 89.6 in 2002 but am retaking it to prepare for calculus II) and the teacher told us we couldn't use our calculators and to put them away.

Well, I just got back my grade and it's a 37/100 and I'm panicking thinking this was all a mistake quitting my career to go back to school just to try and find a career I was actually passionate about.

He proceeds to slap my phone off of my stand in my car and stomp on it. I become irate and start telling him how I didn't appreciate him destroying property.

When I talked to her about it, she said she was confused because she didnt feel anything originally and now she thinks things are changing. I was excited and so I just kept doing what I was doing and things were going great. Things went bad on Friday the 27th. The subject of our relationship status got brought up again and she said she was conflicted and part of her wants to just remain friends and part of her wants something more. I asked her if we could talk about it in person but we had to end up FaceTiming. It turns out all that flirting and leading on was her intentionally doing that to see if she was interested. What I took as affection turned out to be experimentation and at this point she was trying to avoid telling me the truth. Ive been rejected before but this one was different."

Amen! Im glad your focus shifted towards Christ. This pandemic is certainly happening for all people to come to Christ and gain a deep relationship with Him and know how much we NEED Him.

They discussed about the impact of Covid -19 on aviation sector throughout the world. Coming from an aviation background I can see how bleak the future might be. Any area for a favourable outcome during this time for aviation seems unlikely and we can see the effect on a large scale. Right from production factories to everyone related to aviation is under the devastating hand of the pandemic. Job losses, loan repayments, training halted midway are just some of the negative effects which Ive been witnessing in my little aviation circle. Personally, I have been quite tossed around by this turbulence in past too. I believe once you get into aviation you have to make up your mindset about facing such unprecedented times, as aviation is a cyclic industry a lot of factors come into play and the whole sector depends on these factors to work effectively. And Covid has uprooted these factors and brought it to a pause.During such times, one can lose their peace and its ripple effect can be seen in different ways. When we get comfortable at something we avoid going through the process of re-aligning to anything else. Because it takes away our peace and identity."

I cant wait to be held by my husband and parents after my grad walk. My husband has supported me and encouraged me all this time and I cant let him down.

I tried to drive to work after pulling myself together but couldn't go because the road to get to my job was replaced by a ditch for construction.I have been raped, beaten by family, bullied most my life and jumped on multiple occasions.

Day two of being back my very old car then gets a huge hole in the oil pan and the engine is deprived of oil for too long and needs to be scrapped due to critical damage to the engine. The car had a computer issue which would set off four signals: oil light, 'BRAKE' light; 'ABS' light; RPMs drop to zero. Ignored the computer issue on the basis that it was too expensive to get replaced for an old 98' car I only needed to run for anouther nine months. I could have prevented the oil issue, had I fixed it. I also don't necessarily need a car where I live so things will be fine. So fast forward to 1AM last night. I'm about to go to bed after working about 12 hours on a work project that's due on Friday. I realize that because I was moving, and to my own stupidity, I left my birth certificate and SSN card in the back pocket of the driver's seat. That car is now scrapped. So I immediately started figuring out how to order a new birth certificate and SSN. Ordered the birth certificate, and will order the SSN card today. Stay up til 430 AM duper stressed and I still am.I know things will turn up, I'm keeping positive. "

I hope things get better for you.Now, I am no expert on this, but I would like to offer you advice on what may be best.I would recommend seeing a therapist if that is possible. If theyre good, theyll help you find the best solution. And theyll have better advice than I can offer. If they end up not being good, then I would recommend finding another better one.The other thing I would recommend is finding friends in your area. Find people who truly appreciate you and who care for you. Who knows? Maybe theyll even let you crash at their place.I wish you the best of luck in this.

This was the result of emotional eating, then starving myself years after I left a sexually and emotionally abusive relationship.One of my family members suggested her Paleo diet. All she eats is meat, and she lost over 20 pounds (good for her). If she eats anything else, though, she gets hella sick.I didn't want to give up my love of food, so when I met up with my girl friends from university, one of them said she was starting a calorie-limited diet and asked if I wanted to join her. You bet your sweet southern ass I did!We limited our calories to be around 1200 calories a day. A lot of days, I had little food, so I ate as much as I could to satisfy my stomach, even though it was 400-900 calories.

Neither of them fit me, as I was much larger than I anticipated.

I work in a corporate environment so it's very tricky to fire someone. This can be hard bc I'm in need to make an example of so.eone but instead people have figured out how to work the system.

I only have two friends. I got a check for $100 yesterday that I cashed and I have been looking forward to this all week. Even after my birthday that happened this past Wednesday. I had some bills to pay like hulu and neflix which I didn't mind. But i made sure that I was saving enough to I could buy the stuff. I got on the bus. Got some drinks for myself and I got two bracelets from hot topic too but what I didn't realize was that most of my billing stuff happened today. So I went from $60 to $8 cause I didn't know my netflix bill and hulu bill happened today. So after I bought drinks and two cool bracelets for myself, I didn't have enough money to buy my pizzas. I was at target and I had put two digornio's stuffed cheese pizzas in my cart and I was trying to check my bank finances cause I always get paranoid that money is going to disappear. But I had $40 after I bought my bracelets."
GIRL. i know this is gonna sound creepy but do you have instagram or a means of both of us talking over text/dm? I read your old post on being ex muslim and theres a lot we have in common and a  l o t  i wanna say to you. Reach out to me!!,"Ive been feeling kinda down and ugly lately. If you check my profile, you would see that a lot of the recent stuff I posted is similar in idea. I really want to talk to my crush but it would never work out because hes way out of my league. And Im serious. He plays baseball so hes fit, hes super super smart (AP classes! And he never does the precalc hw but he does great every test), hes humble (when I told him I got a hundred on my English midterm, he seemed genuinely happy even thought hes in much higher level classes than me), and hes fairly attractive.Ugh, hes probably the most mischievous little person around his friends and then hes nice- almost shy- with people that arent his friends.  And his face turns bright red, its adorable. He would never like me back. My friends say Im pretty but I think theyre lying. Im not the dumbest (my precalc grade would argue otherwise) and Ill admit Im in honor classes and Ive got a poem published in a book but thats about it. I try to stay fit too so its not like, health wise, were super different. I dont think it could ever work out anyways and I dont think his friends would approve of him dating me and I also think that  he would probably go chase the pretty girls that are also in the AP classes and equally as smart as him. I dont know what to do anymore. Hes all this cool stuff and Im just me and I wish he wasnt so out of my league. Im 16 btw if that changes anything "
"Hugs. Remember that sometimes you have to take life five minutes at a time. If you try to solve all the problems at once, it gets super overwhelming.","I taught part time at a school and they insisted on collecting my bi-monthly $145 checks. I work at a gym but all that money goes into gas for my car since I drive to school. Parents pay the car payment and insurance. They control my clothing, friends, dating, phone calls, monitor everything about me, read my diary, create fake instagrams to stalk me. They tell me Im a child, and not an adult until my father walks me down the aisle to my husband someday. Mother says she sees me the same as when I was 15. I have phone recordings of them cursing me out and calling me names.( Im a fifth avenue slut for not having more jobs and for dating when I should be working 16 hours/6 days a week as a young able bodied woman.) I have 3 jobs, I go to college full time, and Im in the military. Im sorry I got pregnant. Im sorry I chose to terminate the baby, but I couldnt possibly bring a child into a situation that I dont even feel safe in. I felt that I had no other options. Please encourage me."
"I'm praying for you, man. I see that you're trying to make an effort. That is great. I encourage you to keep trying and to maybe pursue that idea when you feel healthy enough to do that, but in due time, there is no rush. That and just do little things. Maybe if you're struggling to take care of yourself, have little goals for yourself (I have no idea where you are at in life, but if it is taking a shower everyday, work on that. If it is finding a hobby and practicing it at least a few hours or an hour a week, do that.)","Blood everywhere. Its left a couple scars. Im lucky Im not blind.I dont want to tell you the whole story it would take a long time to recount all the details and a lot of it was just madness. I feel compelled to mention that I was begging my friends to get a gun and shoot me. I grabbed my friend by the hair and said terrible things to him (were no longer friends). The police came, and I was delirious but not combative, since I had collapsed. During the ambulance ride and for several hours afterwards I was hearing voices. My legs and arms were cuffed to a bed for the entire night. They position you in a certain uncomfortable position so you cant reach your hands close enough together to grab/use anything. I was so convinced that this was Hell, that I used my teeth to pull a cord coming from a nearby monitor and wrapped it around my neck to try to strangle myself.My sense of time became massively warped. It felt like I was in that hospital for 300 years. I eventually calmed down enough that they actually approved to release me."
"Hey friend. Ive been dealing with a similar thing. Ive started to feel a lot more anxious lately and Ive done the same procrastination-due-to-anxiety thing for a while. If you really feel this way, Id suggest finding a therapist. Ive found one and its really been helping me. There are also a lot of mindfulness exercises for anxiety online, which might help you.As for your routines. Dont stop doing them. Perhaps theyll help you feel better and more at peace with yourself. To be honest, I wish I practiced my hobbies as much as you do.Hang in there friend. This too shall pass. For now find the help you deserve","I'm in a very strange period right now and I'm still trying to figure it out, but I'll try to describe it the best I can. Events in chronological order:During the quarantine, I took the time to workout and eat better. I had the discipline and the determination to lose weight and get fitter.Since June, work has been stressful, because of upcoming deadlines. I got me in a procrastination-due-to-anxiety state. My work isn't great, but it's not terrible either. I'm planning on getting at least decent results before July.This weekend, we got very bad news in the family.Since then, I feel like I want to lose control of my life. A small and easy way to do it was to completely wreck my quarantine habits. I've been eating like an absolute mess and haven't worked-out at all for the last few days. I also haven't touched my musical instruments, which I normally practice pretty much every day. Everything is less fun, less interesting, less joyful, etc. I can be distracted for a while, but my energy level and general happiness is much lower than usual. Do you guys have any advice or encouragement?"
"Hey Carbon, you sound really intelligent from how you write! You've got a plan towards your dreams, it just wasn't what you originally thought it was going to be. Life is like that sometimes. It takes a really strong person to stand up from failure and continue to persevere to their dreams. I believe in you and your capability to one day become a doctor. Nursing could also give you a unique perspective on medicine, which is something that will set you apart from other applicants when you decide to apply. You've got this! I'm cheering for you, and I am inspired by your ability to self reflect and move forward with a plan that you believe is right for you, regardless of the opinions of those who don't believe in you.","Former Dream of Being a Doctor, Now Changed To Nursing. Looking for Encouragement.Just as the title says, I once had the dream of being in medical school, but due to my low gpa, changed my focus to nursing and I was looking for encouragement. Little back story:For my the longest time, I would say since I was like 7 years old, I was driven to become hopefully become a Neurosurgeon, I often would read material, watch surgeries, and do whatever I could to help me better understand not only the role of medicine, but how it affects the lives and the crucial role it played in the lives of millions of people. I attend the University of Alabama at Birmingham. I was offered a scholarship to the university while in middle school. By the time I took the ACT my 8th grade summer, I managed to score an 28. UAB was impressed by this and offered me a scholarship. Fast forward, I graduated high school with a GPA of a 4.42. I had taken multiple AP and honors classes and so our GPA had the possibility of jumping past a 4.0. College, the good and the bad:Theres really no easy way to say this and I dont want to beat around the bush by it and since I made the mistake, and I want to own it but, I remember it like it was yesterday, my sophomore and junior year, as much as I hate and am embarrassed to say it, I had a huge falling out when it came to school and life in general."
"Ive experienced similar with my mom so I get the frustration. Do what you think is best for you and follow the path you think is right. Dont completely discount her though because Im sure she just wants what is best for you and just has a funny way of showing it.

Just hang in there and enjoy life, you deserve it!","Ima a 20 yrs female moving out soon with my bf of 5years to rent a place. I feel like I'm being held back mentally because of my mom. Everyday is different with her mood (she isn't diagnosed with anything that I know of) for example: if I hang out most of the day with my bf, her mood is a flip of a coin once I arrive. If I hang out too often then she flips out on me. I'm afraid of moving out because I don't know the outcome of what will happen which ik won't be good. I just need someone to tell me to do it since I need to get out of my comfort zone. Thank you for reading"
"That's rough. It will get better, honestly. Maybe do something for you today (not stimulus related). Get ice cream, go on a walk and get some sun, etc. Take a day where you just take a deep breath... take a nap, eat decent, etc. And then work on a game plan. I know things have been down for you, but you're a fighter. What do you need for gas? Once you get that can you reschedule your interview?","im 19, ive been arrested twice for marijuana. once when I was 17 and then again when I was 18, it was over a year ago and im still going to court for it. yesterday I sat in the court room for almost 5 hours just for them to give me another court date. I broke down and started ugly crying in front of the prosecutor. it was so frustrating. I went to rehab in april. I was bad off on xanax and I overdosed. but it was on purpose. my dad kicked me out, so I moved in with my great aunt. shes nice. but I dont feel like I can talk to her. I got a new job, but I had to quit because the dish guy was harassing me. it got to the point where I was terrified to go into work and all they told me was to just leave him alone. so I quit. every time something good happens 10 bad things happen. I wrecked my car and I have a rental car now, but whatever money the insurance gives me my dad is just gonna use to pay off the car that I wrecked. so getting a new car is on me and I have no money. no job. im getting really fucking tired of this shit. all my friends do drugs so I pretty much lost all of them when I got out of rehab. ive stayed clean for the most part, ive only drank and smoked weed a handful of times. i has a job interview today but I couldnt go because I didnt have enough gas in my car. i just want a fucking break."
"Thanks for this. =)  It's good to see others spreading light and cheer here.

But definitely more light than dark, IMO.  Thanks, all.","Day in, day out, the news doesnt fail to update us on what it does best: BAD NEWS!!!Even though I desperately try to limit myself from indulging into daily news, i cant help but think sometimes.I used to read the news, every morning, right after my morning prayers and some days I will read before the prayers, telling myself that this way I can find more to pray about as if I could ever run short on reasons to pray. Little did I know what effect this intake of news - good and bad - was having on my physical, emotional and even spiritual well-being. So I made a drastic decision to step back a little. But truth is that the news follows us everywhere, it is on our fingertips.However recently I came across a repetitive title that I tried to ignore for a while but it always caught up with me: SUICIDE!!!This 7 letters word has changed and turned millions of peoples lives in directions they wouldnt have chosen otherwise. Suicide has dimmed the light of joy and peace in so many individuals and brought guilt and suffering to those who are staying behind.Suicide has finally made it on my top list of the ugliest words in human history alongside abuse, violence, rape, and bullying.Why should you voluntarily end your life? I would ask. Why shouldnt you if there is no reason, and joy to live?, they would tell me.To all those out there who are considering or thinking of suicide, I am sorry to tell you that  suicide is simply a permanent solution to a temporary problem. And I want to believe that,  when suicide becomes an option, it is not mainly to end life, but to end the pain."
Update? I checked your account and you're still here. How are you feeling now?,Hi! Every time I post for encouragement to end it all people keep telling me to get help and try supporting me by saying Ill get through it but really Ive been fighting for too long.

"This makes me think of the I never thought it would happen to me saying. Whether it is Life Alert or some other piece of technology, people are quick to judge until theyre put in a position where they realize they too are just as vulnerable. There are a lot more worse things to be embarrassed or judged by, so dont let this get you down. Youre incredibly lucky compared to many out there and keep your head held high. Try your best to start letting go of their judgments. Their actions, words and opinions are in no way a reflection of you.

Keep trying to be better, keep trying new things, keep being thoughtful and friendly, and when you least expect it people will come around. You can do it!(P.S Accutain / isotretinoin is a legit cure for acne, and its worth asking a dermatologist about. Also, it probably helped more that I realize)",So I'm only 12 but all my friends have been liked by someone else but no one has ever liked me I wear glasses I have acne All OVER my fucking face Every time I look in the mirror I think about my crush and think why would she ever like thatI just feel like I will never have someone and be lonely all my life help me
Thank you for this!,"And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up, because there had been no rain in the land.
1 Kings 17:7 KJV
God never leaves us stranded, forsaken, or abandoned. If the brook dries up, it's because He has a jar of oil waiting for us. When a disappointment strikes us, we must trust Him for the next move. When a dream crashes around us, look for God's direction and a new challenge. There is always a next step with God; and there are always new blessings - grace upon grace - to claim from His guiding hand. What a great God we have. Have a blessed day.   :)"

During this time from Wednesday to Sunday, I am uncomfortable and nervous. I am under the impression that I''m allowed to leave by myself but not with my son. He finally agrees that the hurricane is no longer a threat and that I could go home. I did allow him to see my son, and try to co-parent like he wished but after picking up my son on Tuesday morning and experiencing how my partner was still being aggressive with me, I finally realized how my emotional and physical safety was at risk.I called the police and reported the domestic dispute and he was eventually arrested and forced to do anger management.&amp;#x200B;After everything had happened, I decided to reconnect with him and try again. I knew this was a bad idea, but I wanted a family and I wanted my son to grow up with family. BIG MISTAKE. As soon as this happened, day by day, my partner was showing his true colors again."
"You're in the best position to assess this, but I think it's a great idea!

Invite all of us in the comments to your wedding :P","I've got my recipes and all my ingredients, but my brain (Which is very good at self-sabotage) has come up with an outcome I'm having trouble dealing with. Putting aside the anxiety I'm feeling about just giving them to her, I'm utterly *terrified* she's going to think this is some kind of assholish passive-aggressive one-upmanship because I'm making the cannoli rather than buying it like she did with the cheesecake. I could just buy the cannoli and cut all this out, but tracking down the recipes and making them has and will help with the anxiety about giving them to her. I also feel the situation calls for the extra effort. I'll most likely say this when I give them to her, but that doesn't make the thought go away or the whole thing any less daunting.So have at me r/encouragement.

"Well friend, I am relieved to hear that you are planning to see a therapist. I understand it may be scary for you, but I can assure you that the therapist will pass no judgement to you and will not yell at you. If, by any chance, that therapist does yell at you, then youll have to find another therapist. You are worthy. Dont let anyone tell you different. And I know youre in pain now and Im sorry you feel that way. I hope the pain subsides for you and I hope you feel better soon. You can overcome this. It wont be easy, but its definitely possible. Just be sure to take as much time as you need to overcome this.But therapy is a good start. I wish you good luck with that.","I'm 31.

I was getting gal bladder attacks regularly for 3 years but I thought I was faking it for sympathy. I spent several months trying to get the pain diagnosed. My job fired me for absences, even though I scheduled them and got written permission. Temp manufacturing work. 1 year and a half. Didn't matter. 1 week later I was hospitalized. Almost died. Several surgeries to remove my gallbladder and several stones. When I got home I should've done physical therapy. I was always active. I put on weight. 100 lbs. I tried to do call centers.

It really is anxiety-inducing sometimes.All we can do is stubbornly old forward.,"I'm actually relatively young (26) , and I'm an artist. But for months I've been more and more fearful of the concept of retirement due to ageing, and ageing in general, I guess. The idea that unless rejuvenation sciencie gets as far as expected, my body will start giving in against my will and I will be forced to stop doing what I like.Is it possible to be efficiently active and old? Or do I reach a point in which I peak and then, no matter my discipline, I am condemned to go lower and lower, never doing as good again? Isn't there something I CAN do? Can it be a matter of attitude?  I already am super productive to counter, but it's not helping that much with the fear.Maybe this is the reason why I'm a big futurist and transhumanist, but I'd like to believe I'm not just delusionally grasping a burning nail and have reasons... But I digress."
So many thoughts of experience and wisdom i just dont know where to start. First you are not the reason for being alone. If your friends jumped ship that quick and didnt take the time to know your side of the story then they arent your friends. A true friend will not leave you during the messed up times. For example my best friend made a dumb mistake and got 30 days in jail. Most of her family and friends who knew about it made her feel like a loser and not a good person. My best friend is an amazing person. She has a heart bigger then mine and mine is the size of texas. She made a bad choice in a weak moment. So i would ask again were they really your friends?,"I guess Ill explain my situation. For about 3 months now Ive been talking to this girl. After our first date she said she didnt feel anything for me and so I tried to move on. After about a week of not talking to her she texted me asking how my day was. Since that day she started talking to me non stop every day. She then started to get kind of flirty and lead me on. When I talked to her about it, she said she was confused because she didnt feel anything originally and now she thinks things are changing. I was excited and so I just kept doing what I was doing and things were going great. Things went bad on Friday the 27th. The subject of our relationship status got brought up again and she said she was conflicted and part of her wants to just remain friends and part of her wants something more. I asked her if we could talk about it in person but we had to end up FaceTiming. It turns out all that flirting and leading on was her intentionally doing that to see if she was interested. What I took as affection turned out to be experimentation and at this point she was trying to avoid telling me the truth. Ive been rejected before but this one was different."

"I don't always try my best because I get scared of success or failure or (imaginary) public opinion, or all the above.

"The 1-800-273-8255 song by logic has one line in it that changed my outlook on the world for the better.Whats the day without a little nightSo simple but so true, sadness makes happiness have worth. The only way you can appreciate happiness it is by experiencing sadness as well. The line is a perfect example of how one cant exist without the other, neither would hold any meaning without the presence of the other.Anyone feeling down on their luck or having a bad day please call that number or if you arent up to speaking to someone there shoot me a pm anytime. I might not respond right away but I will do my best.","Please  know that the darkness before you will end. You were given this life because you are strong  enough to live it and Psalm 23:4 testifies that. You are loved and valued, even if you dont  hear it enough. Your presence in this world adds color to the big picture, so please stay. Think of your family and loved ones and decide otherwise. The rest of us struggling every day are reminded that depression, anxiety, and panic attacks  are not a sign of weakness. Instead, they are signs of how long and how much we have  fought to remain strong. People around us are fighting battles we cant imagine, so let us  gear up with love and kindness anywhere we go for that matter. I am not asking you to fight for  EVERYONES life, I am asking you to look around you and make a difference in SOMEONEs life..Let us all take a step toward loving more, listening more and judging less  Never should we underestimate the power of a touch, a smile, a compliment, or a listening earit can make a difference"
I love helping people.  I needed encouragement today and typed it into the search bar in hopes there would a sub for it.  I was completely surprised when I saw that it was and that its active.  Its rare to find positive people and places on the internet but everyone needs a word hug every now and again.  I got some encouragement today from u/Norfrid and it helped me a lot.  I plan on checking this subreddit daily to see if I can help someone too.  ,"I just realized something discouraging.  r/RoastMe and other forums dedicated to negativity are freakin' massive (1.2M?!).  Disproportionately large compared to r/encouragement or whatever is trending the opposite way.Is it more difficult to do good in this world?

"Dont be afraid to ask questions. Really, ignore them. If you truly feel like you are in a position you are/will struggle to handle, then you can grow into it. Do **not** let other cripple that.","I'm in a job position I have no experience in making a lot more than I deserve. It's a very technical and specialized position that I have absolutely no business being in. My boss liked me so I was promoted to this three months ago despite knowing fuck all what I was doing. Since then, I feel like I've done okay. Like I get the job done day to day but it's more like I know what to do, not why I'm doing it like that. My only resource for questions is a forum for this particular type of work for this franchise. It's the only one of it's kind. That's all I have. Anytime I have a question, that's practically my only resource short of toiling through thousands of pages of policy documentation to find what I need. Today I asked a question on the forum for clarification and was completely humiliated for it. Several people that have been doing this 10-20 years were mocking me over it, cracking jokes about how my company is fucked with me in this position and how clueless I was. Some people came to my defense and encouraged me to keep asking questions but the people mocking me were the ""hot shot"" posters. Big names of very seasoned respected employees. I felt humiliated and alone. I feel like I can't go there anymore to ask questions, and without that, I'm lost. I do not have the capacity to read thousands and thousands of pages of documentation and policy and study them and learn then by heart. I'm lost. I feel like without that, I don't have the ability to succeed. It's well past my bedtime and I can't sleep because of this."
Honestly it might be hormones it happens to me pretty regularly where theres no reason for me to be sad/irritated but I am ,"Today just felt like the worst day ever. Nothing in particular bad happened everyone was in good spirits and happy but today Ive just felt awful. There are plenty of things that are going my way in life. I got accepted into my number one college, I start playing my favorite sport Monday, I have a very good group of friends and I have a decent job. But today I just couldnt shake the feeling of feeling depressed, hopeless, and just a waste of space. Ive been struggling to stay with school and feel that Im going down in all of my classes. Ive felt so short tempered and angry while also feeling extremely depressed and I just dont know whats wrong with me and why Ive felt so awful today."
yeah but more like because I dont have what you have lol. Ive done enough exciting stuff but I missed the basics. think the people I know are often superficial and I lack the enthusiasm about some weird construct theyre excited about anymore. Im getting more political while they party.

I have a wife, 2 kids, a job, a mortgage. I love all of it, but I still feel kind of lonely sometimes. No one in my social circle likes video games, has never heard of Reddit, or anything I find interesting. Any social gathering is talk about news/politics (which is so depressing anymore) or sports (which I dont follow). I know I sound incredibly whiny right now, and thats why I havent said anything to anyone. Is there anyone out there over 30 and feeling like kind of an outcast?"

"First of all, that poem is pretty good. Second of all, I understand what you mean when you say you lack self control.

It hasnt really been anything too serious, but I stay up on my phone playing games that arent even fun anymore. I can never get myself to do my work, or pay attention in school, and I just feel...

I couldnt control it, and the worst thing is Ive started to feel this a lot. I usually imagine myself as a vicious monster in my head, and I imagine running to fast, and tearing so deep into the ground with my claws that I spin the world around myself.I really felt like I was being torn apart from the inside out.

I hope you find a job soon, and I hope it treats you well.What Ive learned from my experience is that when it comes to jobs, if the work environment is good, then youll love the job. Its no so much the field as it is the environment. So my advice is to choose a job with a good environment for you. Then youll learn to like the job. And as a fellow person with Autism, I can say you can make it. It is difficult to overcome and Im sorry that not everyones understanding towards you.

The thing about this university is that there is no project work, no presentation or participation points to help my grade- EVERYTHING is based on the results of a year-end exam. Last year, I failed ALL my modules and had to resit them, which makes me one year behind. This year, I managed to clear two of my toughest modules, but I failed the other two, which means that I now will take 5 years to graduate.My parents and friends are telling me not to beat myself up over it, but I can't help but feel so, so disappointed that I did not pass everything. I had such expectations for myself too.I guess I really feel insecure about graduating a lot later than everyone else I know. I feel really depressed that I can't do well in something that I like."
"I'm praying for you, man. I see that you're trying to make an effort. That is great. I encourage you to keep trying and to maybe pursue that idea when you feel healthy enough to do that, but in due time, there is no rush. That and just do little things. Maybe if you're struggling to take care of yourself, have little goals for yourself (I have no idea where you are at in life, but if it is taking a shower everyday, work on that. If it is finding a hobby and practicing it at least a few hours or an hour a week, do that.)","I feel as though all of me is ready to die.Since I left my job, no more quality health insurance.

"it baffles me how people consider a person who doesn't provide support a ""friend"" or anything above that. the people you call ""family"" are families legally but if they don't provide even slight support or worst, bring you down then they don't deserve to be called family.

But when family members are indifferent or hostile, release your expectations,  and find the love and support you need elsewhere.""  \- Jonathan Lockwood Huie","So I need help, I've been through quite a lot lately. Going to NC with my controlling family, and from that I was depressed for months and my wonderful bf was there for me and encouraging.

Is there a good book on encouraging because I want to have his back and he shouldn't have to give everything to lift me up, I just wish I was better at lifting him up. A small example that we had a fight over. He got a gym membership and I'm allowed to be his guest, it was great until he got tired of going and I was encouraging enough to get him there. He wishes I just told him when we would go because I can't get in without him. He was mad at me because he said that he got us to the gym and I didn't do anything to keep us there. But he also hates this gym and works alot so it's not like I want to force him, I want him to be on board. This is mostly rambling but anything that anyone can do would be most grateful. I love him so much and he deserves better support."
hire someone to help you who can copy your style,Im a design student and we have this huge one year long project as a part of our final exam of highschool into university.

However I need 8-11 days to send it for printing and shipping. I have around 5-6 pages left and the cover pages. Also including the phrasing of the story.

"Sometimes just getting help for and taking care of yourself can go a long ways. Even if you're just in a funk, it can help. I know that money might be an issue for you now though, but if there's any way you would be able to pull it off then I would absolutely suggest doing so.

"Instead, what I do is just try to deal or ride it out. I'll distract myself usually--do something that comforts me or engages me so that I forget about what I was thinking about. As far as making those thoughts go away completely, I haven't cracked it, but I strongly suspect it has to do with forgiveness (which can feel frickin impossible sometimes).

"I hear parenthood refocuses a person's priorities and perspective on life.  The realization that a new human being -- their well-being, education, role-models, their entire future! -- depends on you *should* be a life-changing experience.

I was taught by my foster parents that everything had a price for it even if it was a gift so I get really anxious when someone gives me a gift cause I think, ""Oh shit what's the price for taking this?"" I just... I felt really bad that even though I was able to get like $14 of drinks and two cool bracelets too. I felt bad cause I was telling my two friends I was planning on buy pizza for them and cake even though it was for a late birthday party for me but I felt like such a idiot cause I wanted to proved something for them too and I .... I blabbed about it.......I know it's dumb for getting upset about something like this.....but I was just wanting to give myself a party and just not have other people worry about costs of food cause i want to prove for others and just have fun and relax.....but I got so upset at myself cause I wasn't able to get the stuff I just cancelled everything.....And now I'm just getting drunk on my own to just forget how fucking stupid I can be at times.....I'm...... I'm sorry I couldn't get what I planned to have."

The fact that you want to get help despite the odds really shows you have the potential to get better, wishing the best for you","TW: breakdowns, phsyc hospitals, all that jazzi think i want to go to a phsyc ward (idk how to spell it) but i would have to admit all my feelings to my mom and tell her how i just chanted ""i want to die"" while in my bathroom. i could also probably use an evaluation cuz i don't like self diagnosing. also i would lose my baby siblings for a couple months and i LOVE them they are my world. not to mention all the school stuff i would miss. but i think this is a good idea and i want to go thru with it. can u guys hype me up?"

Memorial weekend. We panicked and chose a medical abortion. We thought I could bleed out, then turn around and Ship. Well, the military is actually putting me through the wringer for not making my ship date. I told them I had a medical issue, and now they want to see the medical file which states a doc gave me methotrexate on 5/29. Now, if I hand this file over theyre submitting it to something called MEPS and it will disqualify me for any branch for at least six months, and due to it being an abortion I may be fully disqualified and need a psych eval. I cant tell my family any of this. They think I didnt ship due to a stomach ache. Theyre livid with me. Yelling at me daily. I know theyre extremely upset.

I feel the same way. Ill try to think of something.,It took me awhile to figure this out but i have a fear of things working out too well for me due to superstitions (like it falling apart ) or just doing so well that i have responsibilities that i cant handle. And it holds me back SO much that i dont wanna leave my comfort zone of doing the same boring things every day even though i hate it so much..Some encouragement or advice would be wonderful:) thanks in advance
"Did this in March and thankfully managed to get a job by May. Sometimes you need to take over and not get pushed around. However, there are usually other ways to do this. Unfortunately, in these situations it is generally the case (I find) that some initiative on my part may have improved the situation, such that perhaps I shouldnt cut ties like that. It feels good to stick it to em, but you technically only hurt yourself. The caveat is that youre feeling great to be free of the tyranny. My point here is that part of a job is going out of your way to preempt the kinds of problems that end up becoming intolerable. Get back on the horse and find something else. Meanwhile, enjoy yourself because unemployment (whether you collect benefits or not) is one of the most rewarding/enjoyable times in life, provided you arent suffering (or your family)","I do enjoy health and wellness so why not? I'm also getting my NASM Personal training certificate and could use an easy side job. I initially started this job April of this year and at first it was incredibly easy being back in retail. Then due to a series of events it got incredibly difficult. No working registers for 4 months, no support from managers, and co-workers who didn't like me. Slowly but surely I realized that it was taking time away from my goals when the whole reason I took the job was to put my goals first. I came into work yesterday, and the last week had been horrible. Total store reset, computers crashing, and no communication from management. I'd decided to make the best of it and do the best I could. When I got in the two workers who don't particularly like me started to correct me on tasks that couldn't be completed yesterday due to computers crashing. Telling me it's no excuse. I just stood there in awe, in all this chaos you have a worker who comes in with a good attitude, does her best given the circumstances, and instead of saying ""Hey!"
Thank you so much for this. I cant tell you how much I appreciate it.,Hi! Im 23 and just started my first job out of college ( teaching). Ive been feeling really down on myself lately.

I feel like Ill never be worth anyones time. I could use a lift. Thanks
"Sure, others are there. But when your part speaks it's just you.The other thing I want to say is follow YOUR bliss.

Acting classes feel like a thing where people would definitely bring a friend along to help them feel less awkward and so i'm sure that everyone in the classes will have at least one person that they know.The problem I have is that none of my friends are remotely interested in acting and wouldn't join the classes with me. I'm trying to get the courage to go alone but right now i'm way too scared to sign up. Any advice on how to not be such a wimp or how to find a friend that likes acting?

I call my partner to inform him that I needed his help because my car was disabled. He asked me to drop a pin at my location and I did but it gave the incorrect address, so I gave him the actual address of where I was. Instead of coming to get me, he started to rant about not wanting to be on the road searching for me. I get irritated and curse at him and from then on he argued me to death about he is doing me a favor and that I shouldn't be talking to people in a certain way when I need something. He continued to refuse to come and get me and instructed me to find someone else to pick me up. When I did, he got upset that I even asked him and proceeded to argue with me for the rest of the day. During the arguments he stated that he wish he never met me and had a baby with me and stated that he wished his son was dead."

"Don't just quit bud! I think you have the passion and drive to become a personal trainer. It may be that a corporate gym might not be the best setting to start off given that it's such a small clientele, and you wouldn't be getting as much experience. It's good to be at a bigger place where clients are being pooled by the trainers. You got this!!!","No other job lined up. I didn't know what I was doing, all I knew was that I couldn't stay there.

February 14th I started my new job at a corporate gym as a personal trainer. It was going... slow. Okay, I guess, but slow.

Hey!  Its going to be okay.  :)  You have done the math and now you know what to expect.  That is a great step to take!   It sounds like this is a big change but change can be good.  So what of you can't pay the electric bill?  Shit happens.  Focus on what's most important.  Do you even need to use much electricity till you get paid next?  Maybe you could cut down on lights or maybe have food on hand that doesn't need to be heated up.   Sandwiches might get old after a while but its cheap to make and doesnt have to be cooked.

My heart races but also feels like it drops into my stomach.  My stomach starts twisting and flipping and getting jittery.  My face becomes flushed and I also feel light headed.Internally Im freaking out but tend to express it through irritation and anger.    And I know it is all fear based and fight or flight nervous system reaction.    I need to move at the end of the month and no matter how much I try to work the math, it looks like Im not going to have enough money to get it done.    Something has to give, meaning I might be able to pay rent and moving expenses but I might not be able to pay the electric bill or buy groceries for my kids.    I dont have any friends or family I can turn to for help. I know these things have a way of working themselves out but it still fucking terrifies me.

"Same here. Im 16 and no one has looked at me in a way that isnt as friends. I used to worry a lot about it but now I just dont see the point in having a girlfriend/boyfriend.

"I think it's brave of you to admit you need someone to love and care. It's hard to do that, hard to reach out, and I'm glad you have.As someone else mentioned, I would suggest finding a church. Even if you aren't religious, I know from personal experience that Christian pastors are often extremely kind people who would love to sit down with you over coffee or dinner and talk it all out. Many of them have had years of counseling experience, and often, they have recommendations for counselors in the area who are affordable, as well.","Right now Im sitting in my dark and empty house and I dont know if I can do this thing called life. Ive been battling this demon for years now. No one knows whats really going on with me. Ive tried to talk to people about it but they all have the same carbon copied answers - Youre gonna be okay. Itll get better soon. Im sorry youre going through this.  I dont think I will though. I know I need to talk this out with a professional, but I cant afford that or the insurance to cover it. Its cruel how the world keeps on going after your own world lies in ashes at your feet. Tbh, I feel empty inside. I have for quite a while now. Thats not really the truth though. I do feel something. Fear. Im afraid of losing those I care about. Im afraid that Im not good enough. Even now, Im afraid that youre thinking Im being melodramatic when all Im really doing is trying to describe whats going on in my head. I know Im self destructive and I dont care.

"I'm praying for you, man. I see that you're trying to make an effort. That is great. I encourage you to keep trying and to maybe pursue that idea when you feel healthy enough to do that, but in due time, there is no rush. That and just do little things. Maybe if you're struggling to take care of yourself, have little goals for yourself (I have no idea where you are at in life, but if it is taking a shower everyday, work on that. If it is finding a hobby and practicing it at least a few hours or an hour a week, do that.)","We sat there talking about the possibilities for an hour straight.I got overwhelmed and needed to cool off in their bathroom. I was looking at myself in the mirror, and I could feel my brain pulsating and *moving*, like it was rewiring so rapidly that it was causing a physical sensation. Ive never felt anything like it.I suddenly felt enormous guilt. It was as if the universe was angry with me. I had opened Pandoras Box. I was this underaccomplished loser that barely achieved anything noteworthy in my life, always felt like a disappointment to my family, and here I had just stumbled across something that could change the world. I didnt deserve this, I hadnt worked for it at all, it was literally something I thought of while I was laying in bed after hitting the snooze button.That was the exact moment my psychotic break triggered. I became convinced that none of this was real. All an elaborate farce. My personal version of hell. I screamed and smashed my head against the mirror repeatedly. I had smashed through the medicine cabinet and wall behind it."
You got this. I have a mother who is the same way. She has no boundaries and feels the need to take care of me. I am the only one of the siblings that isnt married so she is constantly doing everything for me. I had to tell her i was leaving the country to live with my bf for three months. The conversation was hard to start but she was really cool about it. She understood that this is a huge opportunity to explore France and be with the man i love. Dont get me wrong she still calls me everyday but she doing well with me being gone.,I am 24. Have a bachelor's degree and decent savings. I am telling my mother that does not want me to move away that I am moving 4 hours away to live with my boyfriend and take a job opportunity that pays more and is more related to my field.It's going to suck! Could use some encouragement for this tough conversation.

"Oh wow. Love to you. You definitely have a lot of challenges. As I read your story, I wanted to shout Try Keto, and I was so glad to see it was an answer for you, even if not an answer for now. Idk what answers there might be for you, but I know you will find them. I would suggest meditation, because quieting my mind and getting separation from my thoughts helped me. And it's free. Lots of YouTube videos.","Cooking, cleaning, planning meals, doing odd jobs for money. Ive lost everything it feels like but our room mate is covering us for now. I got us food stamps and medicaid and Im trying to get help, hence the diagnosis. Please don't harass me about being on snap, I don't want to be on it and they only give me 25$ a week. Have you ever tried to feed 2 adults on that amount? It's ramen and bread and my weight just stays the same. I lost weight on keto a few years ago. 50 lbs. It alleviated my pcos symptoms. I was so happy. But I can't afford it now. I keep trying. I know that I need to suck it up and suffer through. I know that I should eat eggs for every meal and canned tuna and lose the weight by sheer determination. I know that the pain in my hips and ankles is nothing and I should just walk through it. I know I should take a job and just grind it out every day. But when I think about the pain of that, I feel like giving up and dying. I just don't think that I can do it, or this anymore. I have plans to see a therapist. I have to ramp up to it. I make a bunch of calls and then I am burnt out and have to ramp up to it again. And yes, I know. I should just suck it up and call."
"Even though I did something not the way I should have (which is honestly not the issue with You, that was just bad luck, everyone deserves to be lazy sometimes) I always tell myself that I might have lost something, but I gained experience that will prevent it from happening in the future.

I even have a discord group that has a chat specificaly for venting.","Looks like the depression and disappointment hit me post midnight, as Im currently up at 5 am typing this. You know when only *one* small thing goes wrong then suddenly youre all up in a rut about every life decision youve made? Well, Im feeling really shitty about the fact that technically I allowed two things of my own possession to get slightly damaged, all in one night. Due to being lazy in bed, I asked my dad to shake my lava lamp to let the floating hardened liquid to sink towards the bottom. He shook it too hard, causing the whole thing to fall apart and for the lightbulb to lose one of its connector pieces. He said hed go to the hardware store soon to replace the lightbulb, but Im in slight doubt if the lamp will work after that, feeling that its my fault, in technical aspects. If I had simply gotten up to do it myself, then my lamp would have been fine. This is going to also sound ridiculous, but my new phone (no case, no screen protector) somehow slid off the surface I placed it on while doing something this late at night, causing it to hit the hard floor screen first, getting itself some small scratches on its corners in the process. I know the scratches arent that bad, but my obsessive compulsive disorder really tests my tolerance when it comes to the smallest things. And it was a new phone that Ive only had for a couple of weeks, for crying out loud! Why couldnt I have placed it on the floor or on the counter instead? Ive just been self deprecating for the past two hours, so far.In sum from all of this, how do I effectively diminish the thought of I could have done this to prevent this or that so I can learn from these small situations that have been bothering me for the past couple of hours? I guess I somehow have a compass as to how I can solve this, but hearing something from somebody else would really encourage me."

Finally, he sent a 4-page letter to my house claiming that I caused all of the anxiety, depression, and desire to end it all. I filed a PFA (protection from abuse) against him.

"All you have to do is ask and the worst that can happen is no one has a good answer. Also, as an adult now, I'll be completely level with you that a lot of confidence is something we fake until we start to believe it ourselves.

"Hey, if you go a bit early see if you can find a court support worker to sit with you. I used to be one and would sit with any woman filing for an intervention order against a partner that wanted me to, and I would sit in a way that meant they didnt have to look at the person or see their face, (there were support workers for men filing for orders too) bring a photo of a loved one or memory that makes you smile and whilst theyre saying their piece you can have a moment and take your mind somewhere else by looking at the photo, also remember 5-5-5 breathing if you get anxious, breath in for 5 counts, hold it for 5 counts, exhale for 5 counts. This forces you to slow down, not take in too much oxygen and hyperventilate.","Just need a little encouragement. A man threatened suicide when I told him I no longer wanted to date. I helped him get help and when I thought the situation deescalated, I left. He since has sent numerous texts and emails. Finally (much, much later when I thought this was over) he sent a 4-page letter to my house claiming that I caused all of the anxiety, depression, and desire to end it all. I filed a PFA (protection from abuse) against him. He is an abuser and its going to take a lot to be in the same room as him tomorrow - and to listen to him make up his version of reality, and to fight the protection I am seeking.I am hoping against hope that the judge believes me and is willing to grant this order to give me some peace of mind.UPDATE: abuser tried to outright lie and say I kept coming to his building so HE now wanted an order against ME. My incredible lawyer was not having any of that - and I was granted the order. Thank you everyone for your encouragement. I am so relieved"

"College, however, requires a lot of focus and effort outside of class of you teaching yourself and developing the skills they talk about in the classroom.

Know that your freaking out is normal, and most other students also feel your stress and that it is expensive and don't know what they are doing either. It's ok.

I cautioned myself and explained to him, I can't give the $1000 because I do not have means to do so right now. He went ballistic and basically told me that I put him in debt by throwing him in jail and after all the things he has done for me--I can't help him out. He goes on and says, you've been holding out on me and you weren't going to give me the money anyways. Then he tells me we should just take care of our son.

Of note I'm married with a 6 moth old daughter.Well...I showed up to my first calculus test (I originally passed it with an 89.6 in 2002 but am retaking it to prepare for calculus II) and the teacher told us we couldn't use our calculators and to put them away. We all panic.  I didn't even finish the test.  Well, I just got back my grade and it's a 37/100 and I'm panicking thinking this was all a mistake quitting my career to go back to school just to try and find a career I was actually passionate about.

She's nice, funny, quiet, shy, cute, and from the little bit we've interacted she seems like an interesting person. We haven't interacted much outside of passing conversation because I'm also a pretty quiet and shy person, so the few times I've had the chance I've never been able to think of a way to interact with her without it seeming very forced or making it awkward for one or both of us. The crush level has gone up recently because she got me a cheesecake platter for my birthday. Not an unusual thing as she's always bringing in cookies for everyone but it made my day all the same. I've got the chance to return the favor, but it's not under quite the best of circumstances; She's got a surgery scheduled for this week, and while it's not major she's said she's still really scared (Can't blame her). Add in her having a bout of the flu and she's been in a pretty bad place the last few weeks.I decided to get her something to cheer her up and settled on making her cannoli (I saw from a FB post of hers that she liked it) and spent the last few days carefully finding out her favorite flavors and any food allergies she may have without directly asking her."

"Friend, you are not too old to make art. You are never too old to make art. As for your projects you want to work on. Well, I can just say that I am sure there are people out there who would love your work. As a matter of fact, your work could be the work that becomes their favorite works of art.Consider this my commission. I am commissioning you to finish your personal projects because I am already interested in them.","I'm an artist with original story ideas, many of them over 10 years old, but I've never been able to sit down and finish them. And that fact tends to extend to so many projects. I'm capable of doing so much art for others at huge speeds (commissions) and in that sense I'm super productive (multiple illustrations a day, even if rhey are small). I can easily sit down in the morning and producing art until before bed, but when it comes to my own stuff, it's almost impossible to just sit down and finish projects, be it an artbook, a plot, a comic, a game... I always end falling back into drawing commissions or illustrations, which I can finish with ease.It seems so many gamedevs or comic artists finished projects by the time they were my age or just a bit younger. Shouldn't I have projects behind me and not just illustrations by now? I'm getting closer to finishing stuff, but while I suffer of a quarter life crisis I fear I will just get old too fast to get it all out. It's a scary thought... I sure hope my capacity to produce become exponential with time or rejuvenation therapies become mainstream or something, because the stress is not going to help me make a better product either"
"You can make more coins by following the link up there, if funds has been your reason for worrying.","There is always a way out of whatever you found yourself in.At the root of worry, we find fear. In an effort to overcome that fear, we try to be brave, thinking that if we are brave, we can defeat it. Bravery doesnt replace or take away the fear in our lives; it just masks and gives us enough strength to act. If we want to stop living with fear, we have to replace it with something else: safety. The opposite of being scared is being secure. We need to stop trying to be brave and start being secure in our Creator. Being secure means we have the assurance and knowledge of being safe in Jesus arms. This assurance allows us to overcome fear. We gain this assurance as we grow in our relationship with Christ. As God becomes bigger in our lives, worry becomes smaller. The elevation of God in our lives helps us line up our values and put all other fears in their place. Jesus is the only security that will keep us from fearing and worrying about the unseen. When we are secure in Christ, we dont have to fear. When we dont fear, we dont have to worry. That worry and fear are now replaced with trust. Where fear separates, trust brings together. Where fear blurs, trust clarifies. Where fear disconnects us, trust re-engages us. No, everything wont make sense, but it wont have to. We wont have to try to make sense out of chaos, but, instead, we can trust that God is in it with us. He will strengthen us and help us. He will hold us in His hand. He is that good. You can be secure in that. You can trust that.No need for the worry anymore. https://token.mesmr.tv/"

Not old, i know,, but I've seen more than most people at 20 have and im almost sure of it. I was raised in a very neglectful home,, and Im autistic, nonbinary and physically disabled to top it off. When i was younger, alot of my life was spent in isolation to avoid the sensory overloads or hate that came from being in public, along with the fact that i didn't fit in with anyone no matter where i went. My parents didn't bother to do much when it came to helping me,, only really talking to me if it had something to do with things they were angry with me about,,, so of course, i started wondering,, what is it that i dont have? Why does nobody anywhere like me? And i couldn't seem to figure it out,, no matter how hard i tried to be kinder, or to fit their needs, it only caused me greater pain. And then i got into drawing. Drawing was my first passion,, my first love,, until talent came along. I spent all my days alone, as usual, except this time was no longer spent in silence, sketching the plants and animals nearby, It was spent trying to build a talent. I spent hours and hours of time neglected by others, wripping up scraps of whatever paper i could find, crying for a talent.

The roast me reddit reminds me of a scientific study I read about taking delight in other peoples suffering and failures. This also contributes to the difficulty of spreading kindness,"I just realized something discouraging.  r/RoastMe and other forums dedicated to negativity are freakin' massive (1.2M?!).  Disproportionately large compared to r/encouragement or whatever is trending the opposite way.Is it more difficult to do good in this world?

"All very tough situations to be in, indeed. Try to take on one thing at a time. You can't tackle all of that by over-whelming yourself with the thoughts of how it all might end up. Focus on today and tomorrow. Take a few minutes to write it all down and decide which issue needs to be tackled first. Some of it may fall into place on its own. Try to focus on the little achievements and that will help. Reward yourself when you can.","I feel overwhelmed, I try to be happy, and spend time with my friends and s/o, but Im on the brink of going broke, losing my job and going homeless.

I'll also add if you find a good church that can be a life saver, no pun intended : ) Especially on campus stuff where you know you'll find some peeps same stage of life and same place even!Don't doubt who you are is my encouragement if that's valid - keep an open and mind and keep looking for the right people you want in your life.

Last semester I got straight As but sacrificed my social life for it, and now even when I try to make friends at school, nobody shares similar interests to myself or cares to pay any attention to me. Everyone else just cares about stuff I don't care about like drugs or video games, I want to get out and explore new things. I love action sports but I have lost interest recently due to both my depression and lack of friends to bike and skate with. I really need a girl in my life to help me, I have a more sensitive side that I'm showing now that needs to be vented.

I have messed up so bad and theres nothing I can do. I feel so hopeless.. I lost my soulmate, he was and still is my everything. I dont wanna live my life without him. I cant keep dealing with heartbreak. This has happened too many times. I cant do it. When Im heartbroken I get really bad depression. Im taking medicine for it but it still hurts.

They're the kind that ALWAYS makes fun, even if you're good, because they're jokesters. When I got into school, I jumped into choir as soon as it was available to me. 6th grade. And I loved it so much. When I got to 7th grade, we moved to a new school and the choir teacher there was amazing. She encouraged me, and gave me more and more responsibility for my section and countless solos before adding me to her elite choir that went around and performed live at different places in our city. Even within that choir, she gave me solos and encouraged me. I felt confident and I loved to perform, even just blended into the choir. I loved it. I moved again in 9th grade. This choir teacher was awful. She did nothing but tear me down, hide me in the choir and ask me to be quiet."

This kicks the crap out of my self-esteem and down the rabbit hole I go, spiraling between depression and self-loathing.&amp;#x200B;I am intuitively of the mindset that accepting failure is condoning it so the ability to forgive myself and move on is compromised.

Itll get better soon. Im sorry youre going through this.  I dont think I will though. I know I need to talk this out with a professional, but I cant afford that or the insurance to cover it. Its cruel how the world keeps on going after your own world lies in ashes at your feet. Tbh, I feel empty inside. I have for quite a while now. Thats not really the truth though. I do feel something.

Dating in high school (for me at least) was a total waste of emotional energy. I mean, it was fun in an awkward 20/20 hindsight kind of way. And I guess from a life-experience perspective, it was valuable. Odds are, whoever you date in high school will not end up being the love of your life.","Ive been feeling kinda down and ugly lately.

And he never does the precalc hw but he does great every test), hes humble (when I told him I got a hundred on my English midterm, he seemed genuinely happy even thought hes in much higher level classes than me), and hes fairly attractive.Ugh, hes probably the most mischievous little person around his friends and then hes nice- almost shy- with people that arent his friends.

Then I get an email from my boss. So around November 14th, he tells me I need to ""pause"" work until December 5th due to some cash flow issues that he needs to straighten out. I'm not happy with this but I can't do anything about it because I work remotely from home as a contract employee. But today's email tells me that all of my accounts are being deactivated to ""save money"" and that he hopes the team can get up and functional again in January and he hopes I'll be part of the team then.So I'm essentially now unemployed for all of December which means Christmas is going to suck even more than usual, and I'm probably going to spend the next couple of weeks struggling with the heavier bouts of depression and anxiety again.I've been applying for jobs both remote and local for two months now and I haven't gotten anything, no bites at all.

1 John 4:18 KJV
In Psalm 55:22 it says, ""Cast thy burden upon the Lord , and he shall sustain thee: he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved."" In Proverbs 22:10 it says, ""Cast out the scorner, and contention shall go out; yea, strife and reproach shall cease."" Apostle Paul said in Romans 13:12, ""The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light."" And Apostle Peter to us in 1 Peter 5:7 ""Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you."" As you have noticed it's all about casting. When we learn to love, insecurity and fear of getting hurt, physically and or emotionally shall be cast out. Cast out everything to the Lord and the fear shall be cast out. Have a blessed day.  :)"
"You have a good head on your shoulders.  You're keeping yourself and your son safe and that's important.  Its ok to be sad when any relationship ends.  Good or bad, short or long.  Take care of yourself.   It sounds like you already know how to do that.  :)  I know from experience that there is a huge sense of relief when you leave an abusive relationship so hang onto that.  You already made the hardest decision by leaving and now you have a bright new path before you.  It can seem scary, but isn't it exciting too?!  I know someone here already said this, but if you need to talk or vent, please pm me.  Good luck!  You got this!","I came back to the apartment a short time later and told him, ""I am not keeping your son away from you, but I think it's best that I go home with my because we are not getting a long at the moment."" I created space between the both of us, so he would not feel as if I was in his space or threatening him. Instead, he flew into a rage and started to berate me saying that I was keeping his son away from him and I was like every other bitch that tries to hold fathers back from their kids"" I tell him I'm not keeping the baby away from you- I just want to go home. All of a sudden, he is choking me very aggressively. I defended myself by slapping, kicking and scratching him to get off me. He puts me in full nelson and slams me on the couch. I fall on the floor and the altercation is still occurring and I'm still defending myself by kicking and hitting him in the leg. He punches me the jaw and backs up."
You can do this!!!,I don't know what to say and this is really stupid. I'm just asking for some good thoughts this way. I'm so tired and discouraged and don't want to do this anymore. Please think of me.

All politics aside, its just a really hard time to be a nurse. Long hours, frayed tempers, everyone is on edge. I'm just fried, and I miss my coping mechanisms of pedicures, massages, and spa days. They've been replaced by activities like hiking and meditation - its fun, but it's not what I really want. I come from a big family. We must update each other every week on how we have been. Negative points if you don't make the weekly Skype. Even more negative if you dont 'bring it'and show how you are 'crushing Covid.'I'm so tired. I have about 10% gas left in my tank. I just need a smile, or a nod, or a 'sup' just to say that regardless of where we are, it's going to be okay."

Even if its just 10 minutes of walking, going to yoga, lifting weights, whatever it is, do it every day.

"I music direct musical theatre (well, I used to pre-COVID) and would love to hear your work!  One of my favourite things was when I could invite an artist to work on a show who had a YouTube or SoundCloud channel.

Sometimes their work was so good that we would play it as house music before the show started and at intermission.Please do share with us.  I would absolutely tell you all the things I like.  If you have any questions about recording, do let me know as well, as I was a sound designer for many years before I started directing.As for finding sharing nerve-wracking, I felt the same years ago.

Well, a few days ago I had that again, along with a minor fever, but this time the symptoms have lasted several days. It is totally bearable, but I am just feeling really emotional and tired of being sick. Today my fever is a little worse, and on top of that, I'm in grad school and my current class has us reading several readings a day plus long blog posts. I'm tired of having to read all day, write a long blog post, and being sick on top of that. I just want to lay in bed all day and relax, nap, and cry a little. I apologize if this post is too ""complain-y"" and I know there are much more important things in the world than me being tired of being sick. I am so thankful that I can do school from home and not have to go out for work, especially with the pandemic going on.

"Those last two paragraphs? Tell her thatI'm no good at relationships, but honesty and communication are the best ways to not live with regret","So, I've been best friends for a year and a half with a girl(I am a guy) and I'm talking the kind of friendship that we can tell each other anything and everything and know that the other isn't going to judge and is just there to listen and give advice.In November I finally told her that I had feelings for her after debating in my head for 4 months. She said she also had feelings for me and we were proud of each other for finally letting it out. However, ever since then it feels like there is a rift in the friendship that I had zero intention of creating, you see, I never fully wanted to get into a relationship as she had just started her freshman year of college and I am in my Junior year of highschool(we're only a year apart in age) so we were both stressed with school. I was just tired of holding it in and wanted to get it off my chest.As it stands now, we still talk but it's not the same. It's not the deep talks we used to have, she won't talk to me about anything that's bothering her, and there is something, she's said so multiple times, I just can't get her to open up anymore. I don't know what I did or how to fix it and it's driving me crazy and it's making me feel like giving up on everything. She's the kind of friend that I really don't want to lose and would rather keep as a best friend than ruin that by getting into a relationship. If anyone has any advice at all, it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you."
"&gt; Id love to help you, but the extent of the detail youve given isnt sufficient. If youre pursuing a career in acting, Im afraid youll be entering into untold competition. Science, however, holds its promises as long as its a skill-based field. Service industry is seen to be worthless because sooner or later, those jobs are going to be replaced. Many other trades require you retire early so do keep heed of that, sports being a prevalent instance of this.

The thing about this university is that there is no project work, no presentation or participation points to help my grade- EVERYTHING is based on the results of a year-end exam. Last year, I failed ALL my modules and had to resit them, which makes me one year behind. This year, I managed to clear two of my toughest modules, but I failed the other two, which means that I now will take 5 years to graduate.My parents and friends are telling me not to beat myself up over it, but I can't help but feel so, so disappointed that I did not pass everything.

"My guess is that the teacher wanted to highlight your over reliance on technology without fully understanding the core principles behind it. You were all supposed to fail so those who don't have the stomach to go through with it will drop out leaving the committed to continue. Getting a masters is a hard graft, its best to sort out the wheat from the chaff early on to save cost and heartache down the line. Those who remain have the commitment to learn, they can accept they don't know it all yet and entering a masters with that level of humility is essential to their success. Do not fear failure, fear a world where you are never pushed to your limits. Good luck, you got this.","Hi.

I'm not happy with this but I can't do anything about it because I work remotely from home as a contract employee. But today's email tells me that all of my accounts are being deactivated to ""save money"" and that he hopes the team can get up and functional again in January and he hopes I'll be part of the team then.So I'm essentially now unemployed for all of December which means Christmas is going to suck even more than usual, and I'm probably going to spend the next couple of weeks struggling with the heavier bouts of depression and anxiety again.I've been applying for jobs both remote and local for two months now and I haven't gotten anything, no bites at all.

This is inspiring.,"Hey,, i know it's usually people asking for advice around here, but i recently had a friend needing comfort when it came to talent,, and i think some people need to hear this,,,So, I'm 16. Not old, i know,, but I've seen more than most people at 20 have and im almost sure of it. I was raised in a very neglectful home,, and Im autistic, nonbinary and physically disabled to top it off. When i was younger, alot of my life was spent in isolation to avoid the sensory overloads or hate that came from being in public, along with the fact that i didn't fit in with anyone no matter where i went. My parents didn't bother to do much when it came to helping me,, only really talking to me if it had something to do with things they were angry with me about,,, so of course, i started wondering,, what is it that i dont have? Why does nobody anywhere like me? And i couldn't seem to figure it out,, no matter how hard i tried to be kinder, or to fit their needs, it only caused me greater pain. And then i got into drawing. Drawing was my first passion,, my first love,, until talent came along. I spent all my days alone, as usual, except this time was no longer spent in silence, sketching the plants and animals nearby, It was spent trying to build a talent. I spent hours and hours of time neglected by others, wripping up scraps of whatever paper i could find, crying for a talent.

If you check my profile, you would see that a lot of the recent stuff I posted is similar in idea. I really want to talk to my crush but it would never work out because hes way out of my league.

And he never does the precalc hw but he does great every test), hes humble (when I told him I got a hundred on my English midterm, he seemed genuinely happy even thought hes in much higher level classes than me), and hes fairly attractive.Ugh, hes probably the most mischievous little person around his friends and then hes nice- almost shy- with people that arent his friends.  And his face turns bright red, its adorable. He would never like me back. My friends say Im pretty but I think theyre lying. Im not the dumbest (my precalc grade would argue otherwise) and Ill admit Im in honor classes and Ive got a poem published in a book but thats about it. I try to stay fit too so its not like, health wise, were super different. I dont think it could ever work out anyways and I dont think his friends would approve of him dating me and I also think that  he would probably go chase the pretty girls that are also in the AP classes and equally as smart as him. I dont know what to do anymore. Hes all this cool stuff and Im just me and I wish he wasnt so out of my league. Im 16 btw if that changes anything "
"Hi friend! Just wanted to say that I believe in you. It sounds like this is something you really care about, and something you've put a lot of work into. I bet you know your stuff!It's normal to be nervous/anxious in moments like this, and it's normal to feel 'not ready', even if you've spent a ton of time preparing.

I know you'll do great!","Hi everyone, Im taking a really important exam tomorrow. Since applying for it Ive been dealing with a lot of self doubt and anxiety.

"You survived open heart surgery. Your life is yours to live and do with what you want. This woman clearly is not in the right frame of mind to be a good partner to you. What she said was hurtful and reductive. A good partner would have been extra affectionate throughout your recovery, made sure you took enough time to get better, celebrated your successes and asked you about your follow up appointments.She parroted some hyper traditionalist nonsense that made you anxious at a time you most needed her support.You can do so much better. Your worth in a relationship is not determined by the amount of money you bring to the table. You are not a 'bad provider' for taking care of your health first and foremost. All the best to you. She is probably not a bad person, but she can't be a decent gf to you. Let her figure things out with her family.",Thank you all for your kind words.

You got this!,I'm so tired of living like this. Mother screams at me so loudly and violently that I'm starting to fail school because I spend my time bracing the door to prevent her from attacking me instead of studying like I want to.

"And if you fail from time to time, like humans are known to do, that's okay, just keep going and trying again until it gets easier and you can move on to whatever is next. I'd also encourage you to rest and take care of yourself. If that means getting up early to do a hobby before work, or read a book at night, or something that you enjoy, just try to do that for you. You have value too, I promise. Lastly, I'd definitely encourage you to continue to pursue someplace to go for your mental health. I assure you that there are those who care and want to help you, that's why they're there. It'll be good for you to come together with others and work on your health.","I feel as though all of me is ready to die.Since I left my job, no more quality health insurance. I only have access to basic services. I made an appointment at a behavioral health place nearby, but my first impression was not good. I want to be honest when I go in to seek their help, so I imagine whoever is tasked with speaking to me will find that helping me will be a challenge. I dont want to play nice. This is serious. Ive had a therapist for years, someone who I deeply trust and believe in. But I think not even someone of her caliber can help me now.I dont know what to expect from an online community like this.

I desperately want to communicate this issue but she can already read it off of me (been together for a long time) which is making her mental health worse at times, and I think if we were to outright have that conversation it would cause her mental health to be even worse. She also gets upset that it seems like I view her as helpless and unable to function without me, and admittedly I do because shes so extremely needyI hate myself physically. Literally from my head to my toes: I cant find a good haircut and the barber that I helped out with that couldnt be consistent, then COVID hit and Im out a barber & reference point for my hair. Im in too low of a funk to consistently care about maintaining my beard which is as frustrating as daily care would be.

"Awesome!  Good to celebrate the successes. =DAs an aside, FWIW, my wife (who's a dietician) says that regular meals are important -- the tendency to skip meals is actually counterproductive, even with restricted calories.

"Theoretically, it could happen. There are several animals in nature which seem to be able to infinitely replicate their aging or dying cells.

In theory, these stem cells can be programmed to form any organ or tissue type and then be used as a replacement.

It just makes it sound like I have to hurry everything in my lifestyle and can't take it slow, what a way to do things fast and bad. You can't hurry art!I'd say it's not completely baseless, as there seems to be experiments on rejuvenation already, and I'm in my middle 20s. Of course it does not mean I'm going to live my life carelessly or let it pass me. I already am pretty active to do my best and achieve everything I want to achieve.

Normally, I'd rather have my teeth pulled than ask for help and be vulnerable, but if I don't do anything I'll have to move back in with my parents (I'm not sure I can survive that and it wouldn't be easy to do b/c of their own issues).

I guess just try and make sure they don't ruin you for the next new people to come under you.  Can you take this to your supervisors and get them to smash some sense into these guys?,"I'm feeling really low. A few months ago on I was promoted to my first management position. I was so excited to be In leadership and I really thought I could make a difference in someone's career. About 2 months ago I got my team, all new hires, and almost all straight out of  college with little or no job experience. They are so rough. After rigorous training almost all of them are rough, to be expected of course.What I wasnt expecting is to have 4 HR issues right of the bat and them escalating me to leadership above me. I have 3 that are are written warnings for attendance, 1 more and will be termed. 1 went to my leadership and asked if I was right. Unfortently I so know this may happen as people might be unhappy, especially if they are having performance issues. All day my leaders tell me that i have such a bad team and they feel so bad for me, that I'm doing great handling it and it's really breaking me in. I work in a corporate environment so it's very tricky to fire someone. This can be hard bc I'm in need to make an example of so.eone but instead people have figured out how to work the system. I go home and I feel so low. I guess its bc I really wanted to be great to my team but I feel like the group I have is horrible. They always have an issue, whether personal, or just unhappy with the job. They come in with a negative attitude and it sucks the life out of me to be positive for them and the rest of my team. The hard part is the need to treat them as though I dont hate them and still provide great management and fairness. I'm just kind of complaining but I'm in some real need of any encouragement right now. This job is not what I wanted it to be and I'm becoming really unhappy due to it."

Growing up movies were my escape, fantasy, sci-fi l, action movies.All were better than my life and the older I got the more I wanted to spend time in those worlds than our own.I just thought maybe Ill start a blog doing movie reviews.... A few friends of mine came over for dinner and we got into shit talking and some how landed on doing a YouTube channel We all loved movies and I thought what the heck why not? Whats the worst that could happen?It doesnt get popular, no one watches us... But I can at least say, hey I gave it a shot, even though it failed Im glad I wont have to wonder what could have been Anyways I threw my entire free time into this project building the website creating the YouTube channel learning how to do graphics, design, effects, and sound A year later I fell in love with this project.No we didnt take off and become youtube famous.But on the other hand the most important thing for me is, I got to appreciate life and it feels good to make something with my own two hands and be able to say I did this.I made this and brought into the world I have no idea who the person was who encouraged me to pursue a hobby like this.Whoever you were, if you ever read this I just want to say thank you from the bottom of my heartI also want to thank this community for continuing to encourage me even though Ive never posted on here. Many of us read all the conversations and posts so thank you :) this is a much needed community and place for a lot of us to find encouragement Anyways heres my YouTube channel its been a year!"

"I saw it. ) Check-a-roonie.Change is stressful under any circumstances. My advice and prayer for you -- take some time to relax and be with the people you love. Make it a date, even better. Put on some kick-ass music and take control of your apartment again (I bet you and hubby will both feel better after that). When the world feels out of control... just focus on doing things that you can control. It may not seem like much, but it will help. And if all else fails, you always can come back and chat with random strangers on the internet who care about you. Best wishes!&amp;#x200B;",I just quit a job I loved and I've started at my new place.  They're really different but my old boss was abusive and careless to his employees and I couldn't take it anymore.  I went back to a place I had worked before and I also love it for different reasons.  I'm 28 and I haven't found a solid career.  My new job has offered to pay for classes to get my LTP as I work at a tax firm.  It's really tempting because I would get to stay here with people I love and the pay would be great but my old job was working with kids which i love more.  I want to continue working with kids but I would need to go back to school to have jobs that pay enough.I have anxiety and all of this change and stress has been getting to me.  I haven't cleaned my apartment in weeks.  My husband and I currently live in a low income apartment building which doesn't allow for full student households.  He is in school and if I take classes we would have to find another place to live.  All of this is stressing me out so much and my husband is stressed out and checked out.  I need anyone to talk to but I'm afraid to talk to my friends about this.  When I talk to my husband he doesn't say much.  I just need even a shred of support from anyone because the person I need it from the most is not in an emotional or mental place to give that.
"I am at the one place that I felt loved in my entire life. A 3 year old showed me love and acceptance that day, it was also the day that her mother started distancing from me.

I won't have that life that I had for that day.","I met her very young daughter and fell in love with them even more quickly. She told me she loved me and wanted a future with me. We promised that if it wasnt working out we would tell each other and not just ghost the other, we did a pinky swear that we would not breakup over text, that we would not ghost each other as it had happened to us both, we would show each other the love we feel in that moment as a promise.We did OK for the few weeks after she was laid off and we couldnt go out as much. I tried to help with as much money as I could, but as the weeks progressed I started to feel like an ATM again, she stopped texting, she stopped calling, only when it was time for me to give money would she come back, now we have slowly drifted apart more she didn't come back last week when i got paid. And now I dont feel anything is left. She has been distant for a long time now, not texting or answering calls. She only said she has shit going on but nothing more. She doesnt say I love you anymore, she doesnt even say hi or I miss you. It is as if I dreamed her and I am waking up from that dream again, and she was never real.I feel that I have been just dropped yet again, but this time I let my heart believe it was different."

"Hey friend, Im not an expert on this kind of situation. I just wanted to give you some encouragements and give you what I do know. I understand that youd want to move out. If I were to make a suggestion, I would advise trying to reconcile with your mother. Confront her by explaining how she hurt you, apologize for hurting her if you did hurt her, and find ways to mend the relationship. But if you put forth that effort and she still fights back against you, then it might be best to move out.If youre worried about loneliness in moving out, try finding some friends who can help you.

I've been grappling with moving out, knowing full well she would never approve, and likely choose to disown me. A few days ago, we fought, and she gave me an ultimatum to move out by the end of the month. There's so much going on inside my mind - anxiety that our relationship will be irreparable, that this is a terrible and unsafe time to move (covid and right before the holidays), of whether I am good enough/mentally strong enough to live alone, if I will be able to find a place in time. Does it make the beast less terrible if I understand my beast? I'm deeply worried, and I'm hoping that someone can point me in the right direction and tell me about a time it all worked out for them."

I am very very scared and anxious. Could use some pointers and such. Thank you random internet people.
"And when you accept that fact, it changes your life.If you're worried that you're not the same person you were before the break ... everyone wakes up different than they were yesterday. Is that a bad analogy? Maybe. Change is something everyone encounters, just in varying amounts and in various ways. The important thing is deciding how to respond to it.Sorry if my words weren't magic, but I hope you know they are at least sincere. Be well.","Blood everywhere. Its left a couple scars. Im lucky Im not blind.I dont want to tell you the whole story it would take a long time to recount all the details and a lot of it was just madness. I feel compelled to mention that I was begging my friends to get a gun and shoot me. I grabbed my friend by the hair and said terrible things to him (were no longer friends). The police came, and I was delirious but not combative, since I had collapsed. During the ambulance ride and for several hours afterwards I was hearing voices. My legs and arms were cuffed to a bed for the entire night. They position you in a certain uncomfortable position so you cant reach your hands close enough together to grab/use anything. I was so convinced that this was Hell, that I used my teeth to pull a cord coming from a nearby monitor and wrapped it around my neck to try to strangle myself.My sense of time became massively warped. It felt like I was in that hospital for 300 years. I eventually calmed down enough that they actually approved to release me."
Good luck! :),I am about to ask a girl to prom wish me luck. 
"Most of my girl friends that got married at your age have had very difficult marriages and most have divorced. Things at your age are experienced on such a deep level; emotionally and physically that it all seems what happens between ages 15-25 sets your life forever. It seems so real that, to many, what happens these years somehow sets the remainder of the rest.BUT, it doesn't. So much changes after college. Know that as you age, you learn so much more. What ""real"" you experienced builds over the years. The friendships you establish become more cherished. You meet many more people - when you start your career, when you begin to travel and when your networking expands. Cherish your friendships.","I've lost 25 lbs, I am almost done with my degree, I am fairly good at communication and other ""green flag"" things people say are good. I'm a little chunky still and my anxiety says that if I was skinny I'd be getting engaged too, which sucks but is hard to unthink. I'm trying so hard not to compare myself to everyone else but it fucking sucks and I feel like it is a me problem somehow but nobody ever is able to tell me what went wrong. I'm only 22, I should have time; but my career is likely to take me somewhere that isnt a city and I feel like I've lost my chance. I want to start a family someday, but idk where to meet people after school. I'm not afraid of being single, but I am afraid of being alone forever. Also I'm too scared of looking weird to go to bars by myself but none of my friends ever wanna go. Somebody say something lol  tough love is totally ok I just need a push to get over myself"
"I am not the type that likes to be jokingly teased. But when it happens on a group it leaves us feeling vulnerable. The best thing to do is deal it back to him. Or even talking him one on one.

This server also has their friends, and one of them is a jerk. I was just in a huge argument with him. He instigated it and insulted me a lot more then I did him. In the discord we tried to make it like a democracy. Then this guy came and ruined it. He has no respect and really just a sucky guy. I can tell his parents are either overwhelmed with a lot of kids or their bad people. He clearly doesnt get the support he needs and hes a bully. I just left the discord and Im trying to get some of my friends to join my new one but only one has joined and he says he might not stay for long. I really need some encouragement right now, so Im asking a bunch of internet strangers. P.s. taking a walk to cool down hopefully it makes me feel better.Update: one of my friends was trying to force us to talk before I was ready. After a bit I got to stop. Thanks for all the advise it means a lot."

Dude the world rarely congratulates us in a compensatory manner to our work. You did it. Buy a McDouble and enjoy the moment.,I am a struggling makeup student for 3 years and I finally got my first paid job for working on set for a short film. I was extremely anxious over it and stayed in a hotel for 4 days just to get some work experience which I never thought I could do this early on in my course. I did it and smashed it and I wasnt tagged in the promo post by the director who is also a student btw when he tagged everyone else. My parents werent too fussed either. I thought this was gonna be this massive achievement but now I feel like maybe I shouldnt feel so proud of myself as I am.
"Friend, I cant say I know what you should do, but I can encourage you. It does sound like a difficult cycle. So I hope it gets better for you. May others treat you better and may you treat yourself better.If you feel it will help you, perhaps a therapist could help. That therapist certainly would know a lot better than I do","If Im enjoying myself, I dont get anything done, I gain weight, and I hemorrhage money.In order to work, maintain my weight/be healthy, and not spend money that I dont have, I have to be really strict with myself.When Im strict with myself, I dont enjoy life and dont have the energy/mental space to perform I AM HAPPY AND FINE in the old ways that make others comfortable. When I dont perform and make others comfortable, they act worried, upset, and overly observant of every little action I do.When others act like that, I get annoyed that theyre so obsessive over what Im doing. I resent having to act a certain way so that theyll leave me alone and also not be upset themselves. When I am annoyed and resentful, I say things that upset people more (even if Im just trying to explain).When people are upset, I cant concentrate on myself and what Im trying to do (work, be healthy, save money). I dont know what to do/how to break out of this cycle."

Its the greatest opportunity to find yourself and know who you are when everything is bleak and only to get worse,"I have always struggled with anxiety and depression, and the current state of the world has compounded it a thousand times over. Between street violence to cities burning to COVID and political corruption on all sides, I feel like the only future for America is a bleak one. Im not suicidal, but I sometimes wish for an accident to remove me from this ridiculous society.   I need to know things will be ok, but I dont think anyone knows for sure."
"Not owning a lot of stuff is always a good idea, and in your case, practical. Maybe have 3 sets of stuff to keep in each house, so you don't have to pack every time you move. Also, look into podcasts for your long car rides, there are some amazing ones around. Good luck!","Hi Reddit! I could use some encouragement. My living situation is really weird right now. Three days/nights a week, I live in a small city for my master's program. During that time,  I live in a house with this random older woman (she's nice, but still random) and a roommate. It's comfortable enough, but def not my home and I always feel like a stranger/guest. The other three nights a week, I live with my fiance four hours north in an apartment that we don't love in a town we both hate (it's super rural, we miss our families & friends in another state, etc). So, half the week I'm at school in a weird living situation, and the other half I'm with my fiance in a weird living situation. So, my car is kind of my home. I keep all my stuff in my car all the time (so yes, it's a mess). This arrangement will only last until Christmas break, so I have like 10 more weeks to go like this. This whole thing was my decision and done by my own hand, so I really have no right to complain, but it is still confusing and difficult. To make it all even more weird, one of my professors also hired me to house/dog sit a few nights a week, so I'll also be staying in a third house sometimes coming up. Anyone else ever lived out of their car, kinda? Please share any encouraging thoughts or ideas with me to get through this odd phase of my life!!! "
"Love, it hurts! You are making hard choices for a better future! You can stay strong, and keep trying! ","I get up to flee, slip and hit my face on the ground. I try to go and get my son he blocks me from doing so. I end up getting my son and running out of the apartment. I walk up the sidewalk a little bit to calm down and when I return to my car he is blocking my driver side door. I ask him to move several times and he refuses. I tell him if he didn't move I was going to call the cops. He snatches my phone and tells me that I'm not. It was evident that he was not going to allow me to leave."

"Starting a new career is really brave and so many people dont have the guts to do it. You are strong! You can do this with or without your familys support, I know it!","I have a shitty job and a very unsupportive family. While having dinner, I told them about my plans to leave my full time job and build my own career on freelancing. Not even a minute in my explanation and theyve already bombarded me with a lot of questions and doubt. I know freelancing is hard like really really hard but its something that makes me happy (I currently have a part time job which is essentially what Ill be doing as a freelancer) and I know starting from the very beginning will be extremely hard but Im mentally prepared for it. Ive also saved enough money to live for a year which Im confident that Ill be able to get clients by then. It just hurts to know that none of the people I consider the closest to me support me in what I want to do. Its seriously taking a toll to my mental health. Ive been wanting to do this since last year but I just didnt have the right skills and financial stability yet. Now I know Im ready but it feels like its dragging me down with all the doubt that my family has around me. I easily get affected by what other people tell me which sucks big time.

"Sometimes life doesn't work out the way we wanted it to and it's okay because everything works out the way its supposed to. Take care of yourself and work your hardest to only move up from here on.

Something that even on the worst of Monday's and even though it's very hard work I'll just love doing it. Unfortunately, I don't think I'll ever have that. I was born in Toronto Ontario Canada and I'm Autistic and as a child I was misdiagnosed and wasn't given the treatments and therapy I needed. I was put into a special class but it was for kids with ADHD which was what I was misdiagnosed with which I didn't have. Well, I never did well in school because I didn't get the help I needed. To make a long story short I just wasn't making my milestones or coming anywhere close to them so my parents pulled me out of school and homeschooled me. Now, when my parents homeschooled me there wasn't much information about it and not a whole lot of people did it, it just wasn't as common as it is now."

Im so sorry. Ive also met a lot of cruel behavior by men on dating apps. Each time I wonder why theyre doing it because its not gonna get them a date. And then I realized its just sadism as entertainment and to blow off steam. and idk i feel like its been increasing since quarantine started. anyway Im immediately filled with disgust at that thought and I feel myself emotionally moving away from that whole interaction. I think what a pathetic little worm. and then my hand automatically closes the tab as if Id seen a literal disgusting worm. and then its closed and then its gone :-),"Ive had less than perfect experiences on dating apps (including racism and sexism), but last night really put the icing on the cake.This guys opening line was telling me that I look like a man. And then when confronted about it, claimed that his friend sent the message. Like I know Im not conventionally attractive, or thin or white, but to go as far as to say I look like a man, really, REALLY hurt."
Happy birthday!  I know you feel lonely and things aren't going great but keep your chin up!  I saw you posted that the pain is getting better so yay!!!  It will get better and if you need to chat you can reach out to me or post here again!   Have a great day!!!   *internet hugs*,Hello everyone!This is my first post on Reddit. I haven't been feeling too well lately I was throwing up and had a really low blood pressure due to anxiety ups and downs and I injured a part of my back on my birthday today and could hardly walk because of all the pain. Just felt kind of lonely since I have also had a hard time emotionally lately due to a lot of stress and don't really have friends or family like people that knew at all where I am and it's just raining the whole time lol.

I could just buy the cannoli and cut all this out, but tracking down the recipes and making them has and will help with the anxiety about giving them to her.

"Hang in there, u/rockrchick21. You're in good company. I bet half of Reddit proper is in the same position.(I mean jeez, I'm over 30 myself and haven't a clue what I'm doing with my life!...

He is in school and if I take classes we would have to find another place to live.  All of this is stressing me out so much and my husband is stressed out and checked out.  I need anyone to talk to but I'm afraid to talk to my friends about this.  When I talk to my husband he doesn't say much.  I just need even a shred of support from anyone because the person I need it from the most is not in an emotional or mental place to give that.

Dogs love is unconditional, always there for you, always glad to see you, ready to forgive you, love going places with you, will protect you from danger, and on and on. We would be fortunate to have a human friend who is faithful as a canine friend. Actually, we do have such a friend and such more than a four legged friend. That friend is Jesus and He understands everything we go through in life. Jesus can sympathize with our weaknesses. Human friends may disappoint us, but Jesus never will. He is a friend that ""sticks closer than a brother "" (Proverbs 18:24). Have a blessed weekend.  :)"
"Fellow human, I am sorry to hear about your lava lamp. Sometimes dads don't know their own strength. It is certainly not your fault that it was broken, it got broken, this doesn't have to be the fault of anyone it just is what it is.  As for the phone that one really stinks.I have suffered and learned through practice that one of the best things to do is to just focus on blessings.

You know when only *one* small thing goes wrong then suddenly youre all up in a rut about every life decision youve made? Well, Im feeling really shitty about the fact that technically I allowed two things of my own possession to get slightly damaged, all in one night. Due to being lazy in bed, I asked my dad to shake my lava lamp to let the floating hardened liquid to sink towards the bottom. He shook it too hard, causing the whole thing to fall apart and for the lightbulb to lose one of its connector pieces. He said hed go to the hardware store soon to replace the lightbulb, but Im in slight doubt if the lamp will work after that, feeling that its my fault, in technical aspects. This is going to also sound ridiculous, but my new phone (no case, no screen protector) somehow slid off the surface I placed it on while doing something this late at night, causing it to hit the hard floor screen first, getting itself some small scratches on its corners in the process. I know the scratches arent that bad, but my obsessive compulsive disorder really tests my tolerance when it comes to the smallest things. And it was a new phone that Ive only had for a couple of weeks, for crying out loud! Ive just been self deprecating for the past two hours, so far.In sum from all of this, how do I effectively diminish the thought of I could have done this to prevent this or that so I can learn from these small situations that have been bothering me for the past couple of hours? I guess I somehow have a compass as to how I can solve this, but hearing something from somebody else would really encourage me."
You are doing the right thing. It shows that you care about yourself and your own well being. And Im happy about that. Keep at it my friend. Self care is important. And who knows?

You already made the hardest decision by leaving and now you have a bright new path before you.  It can seem scary, but isn't it exciting too?!

The instructor told us we can go to a birthing room, but there wouldn't be enough open rooms for everybody. We get a late start to look for a room and of course all of them are occupied.We return to the common area, and he gets an attitude and starts to pout and scroll on his phone and refuses to do the activity with me in the common area. I try to get him to participate but all he said to me was ""I do it when I feel like it"" and continues to act childish, so I give up and wait for people to return to the common area.When we're on our way home, he conveniently starts talking to me telling me how he wants to catch the baby and I ignore him. He doesn't like the fact that I didn't respond to his request so he starts berating me saying, ""that's why all black women are single mothers, because all of you are dysfuctional, you're dysfunctional."""

Those closest to us often don't want us to change or don't believe we can.The good news is there is nothing they can do to stop you from putting in the work to achieve that dream.  It may be better to talk with them less and find people that will support you.  I don't know your family, but I highly doubt they're trying to hold you back. You don't need to judge them actually. You can simply choose to be around them less without having any hard feelings for them. At the end of the day you have to do what's best for you. You've got this.

I know freelancing is hard like really really hard but its something that makes me happy (I currently have a part time job which is essentially what Ill be doing as a freelancer) and I know starting from the very beginning will be extremely hard but Im mentally prepared for it. Ive also saved enough money to live for a year which Im confident that Ill be able to get clients by then. It just hurts to know that none of the people I consider the closest to me support me in what I want to do. Its seriously taking a toll to my mental health. Ive been wanting to do this since last year but I just didnt have the right skills and financial stability yet.

I am also working 24 hours per week at job so I could live on my own, pay the bills, pay for food. Not a dream job, but it pays the bills. Tommorow I have an exam in a subject that I was not attending for almost half a semester because being there in lectures is just as useless as just not being there. (Was doing other homework in the meantime though, so suppose it was more useful to not be there in the end). About this particular subject I am completely clueless and I should gather my strengths today so I could get past 'fail' tommorow. But I just want to be lazy for once so badly !  I want to do something for my personal goals, I want to spend some more time with my boyfriend, I want to meet my mom, I want a whole day just at home. I like my studies because it is finally something I am very much interested in (except tomorrows exam, but it's only a small part of everything). Still it is hard. I wrote myself a letter in the beginning in autumn that was delivered to my during this hard time of exams. I had forgotten about it and I was very moved when I received it. My past self says that she hops that I am just as inspired as she is at the moment and hopes I am getting enough rest and she is very proud of me. The last part is the one that moved me so much, I think I just don't get enough reassurement that I am doing enough.

"(Also, skinny bitches are so 90s.) Also, nutrition/fitness tip: take up walking or jogging outside. Youll probably be burning over 150kcal/mil.

Hells yeah.","I'm 19, I weigh 235 lb I used to be 250 at the beginning of the year, but it's really hard to keep exercising. Just today I was at the gym not 10 minutes ago and a couple of super skinny super hot girls just snickered at me. Part of it's probably because I'm paranoid but I feel like they were saying look at the fat girl trying to be like us Jesus Christ she doesn't f****** belong here. And so I ran home. I don't know if I can keep going to the gym and having those negative experiences.

"Geology looks promising for you. Especially considering it's something you're passionate about. It's certainly been on your mind for a long time.

Or do you think you'd regret not going for it?This seems like something you really want. So, go for it! Don't do yourself a disservice by trying to be safe. Safety is really not really ever promised anyway.","I've been away from school for a few years dealing with personal things and now I'm finally deciding to go back.

But this is not a decision I'm making lightly, and it's one I've spent many many nights thinking about. It seems every time I bring up these fears with people they advise me to keep waiting until I'm sure, or to think about getting a different degree. They love me and are trying to support me, but I think they miss the point... and I've only felt worse since I began making these fears known. To clarify I'm going back for a science BA in geology, a passion of mine. Any sort of words of positivity or encouragement would go a long way for me. I try my best to be an optimist, but lately I feel very pessimistic about this very big deal in my life that I was originally looking so forward to. "
Love it. Edit to *cannot give* I think thats what youre saying,Because it takes a lot of courage to actually admit that you can't give them the love and allow them to find someone else who can love them like you should. It's a selfless act that takes a lot more courage and pains than you realise.

You know when only *one* small thing goes wrong then suddenly youre all up in a rut about every life decision youve made? Well, Im feeling really shitty about the fact that technically I allowed two things of my own possession to get slightly damaged, all in one night. Due to being lazy in bed, I asked my dad to shake my lava lamp to let the floating hardened liquid to sink towards the bottom. He shook it too hard, causing the whole thing to fall apart and for the lightbulb to lose one of its connector pieces. He said hed go to the hardware store soon to replace the lightbulb, but Im in slight doubt if the lamp will work after that, feeling that its my fault, in technical aspects. This is going to also sound ridiculous, but my new phone (no case, no screen protector) somehow slid off the surface I placed it on while doing something this late at night, causing it to hit the hard floor screen first, getting itself some small scratches on its corners in the process. I know the scratches arent that bad, but my obsessive compulsive disorder really tests my tolerance when it comes to the smallest things. And it was a new phone that Ive only had for a couple of weeks, for crying out loud! Ive just been self deprecating for the past two hours, so far.In sum from all of this, how do I effectively diminish the thought of I could have done this to prevent this or that so I can learn from these small situations that have been bothering me for the past couple of hours? I guess I somehow have a compass as to how I can solve this, but hearing something from somebody else would really encourage me."
"Venting certainly helps relieve stress: whether it's on a blog, in some artwork, written letters... however you can express yourself.  The negative experiences tend to stick in our minds, and it's good to let them pass through.I'd also encourage you to focus on positive things too.  We tend to become the things we focus on.  It helps to remember that there are blessings all around us, even in bad times.  Even one enjoyable moment, savored and recalled, can lead us to seek more.","Been feeling like crap for about a year now, thought about creating a blog to vent it out since I cant seem to speak the words out loud.

Dogs love is unconditional, always there for you, always glad to see you, ready to forgive you, love going places with you, will protect you from danger, and on and on. We would be fortunate to have a human friend who is faithful as a canine friend. Actually, we do have such a friend and such more than a four legged friend. That friend is Jesus and He understands everything we go through in life. Jesus can sympathize with our weaknesses. Human friends may disappoint us, but Jesus never will. He is a friend that ""sticks closer than a brother "" (Proverbs 18:24). Have a blessed weekend.  :)"

Oh yeah, and buy a couple new pieces of clothing and rock it :)","I have a tough time connecting with my dad (mom died 18 months ago).

Thanks for posting this. This helped me,"A big question I think a lot of people are asking these days is why are we so depressed, why are we so anxious. We are more anxious and depressed these days because of our culture. With the internet and media we are under a microscope and we are constantly being pressured to be perfect. Perfect body, perfect skin, perfect routine, perfect eating habits, the way you sleep, the way the way you stand, the way you parent, perfect fulfilled fun lives. Every single thing we do we are pressured with the fact that we arent good enough. We arent doing it right. We arent doing it perfectly. We live in an illusion that some people are but its all just a magic trick. People put on a fake face. No one truly knows whats real anymore, so we sit there thinking we arent good enough, we arent as good as everyone else. We have access to all the bad news around the world like never  before. So on top of being perfect we have things like global warming, the entire world that needs to be fixed to worry about too. So let me just say this...Slow down. You will not be perfect. You will not live those glamorous lives you think are real. Just stop striving for perfect and start striving for your best, you will never fall short. Work hard, love hard, and take care of yourself."
"I feel like sometimes when we get bored or stagnant, we turn to eating. Sometimes in the middle of the afternoon at my office, it feels like I'm constantly wanting to eat something. A few things I did, was getting some gum to keep at my desk, and getting a glass of water when I feel like eating. Sometimes just having that substance to drink/chew on helps curve it until it actually IS time to eat. Something else you could do is buy a bag of that small crushed ice (you can get it at Sonic Drive-in in my area) and chew on that. It's really just tricking your brain into thinking ""here, I'm eating something"". Good luck and I hope that helps!

Youre not the things she said. You are you. And thats all that matters.Im sorry you had to deal with this and I hope you recover well,For 4 years I have been dating a high functioning autistic woman. (30) She lived with her parents for the entire duration. Recently her father quit his job because he couldnt take a vacation the days he wanted to.Within 3 days of hearing this story I was informed they would be moving across the state and that she would be going with them. Note at this time we had plans for marriage and had a great relationship.Today she ended our relationship. Her reasons where not her own they were the exact parrotings of her parents far right wing conservatives note that I am not white or conservative. We never let this affect anything or even talk about it. 3 months ago I had open heart surgery at 29. I now noticed since then things have gone downhill.Long story short she made me feel used worthless and broken. That I dont have my life together and cannot be a Provider. But I know these are not her words. Unfortunately nothing I say will bring her back. I just need some assurance Im not those things she said. Please.

IMO, resistance to change comes mostly from fear: that you're somehow disrespecting the relationship (which he's already done), or that you're worried about the possibility or difficulty of making new friends.&amp;#x200B;Short answer is: you deserve good company. No shame in that, so embrace it.Long answer is:1) Friends support each other. If this guy and the others on the Xbox party don't value your friendship, then consider finding others who will. Mentally-speaking, ""you are what you eat"", right?","I've been friends with this guy from across the country for 2 or 3 years now, and I feel like he's been causing me pain for a while now.  I truly thought I enjoyed his company, but now it feels like a redundant step down morally.  He somehow manages to make everyone think he's enjoyable to talk to.  Meanwhile everyone in the Xbox party is being told why their bad or why he's not playing now and it's your fault.  I don't want to end a friendship with someone that's been a part of my life for so long, but him and everyone else on there keeps dragging me back.  It's practicality become an addiction to get on Xbox the second I get home instead of practicing guitar or working out, stuff I want to do.  Even when I thought I could trust him for good advice when I told him that I was depressed he said some bullshit about, ""depression isn't real,"" and ""most people are just looking for pity.""  It's degrading to talk to him, and his posy.  I just don't know if it's worth it to abandon years of voices and personalities for something I'm not even sure if I have the commitment to do.  What do you guys think?"
"You should dance because you love it, u/fabushiki .  Dance because you must.  Not because you want it to be a career.  Your teacher may be correct, but the same could be said for any sport or profession, I suppose: an early start is almost always helpful. At the same time, lots of people get into professions late.  (Feel like I just read an article the other day about a 90 year old going to college to be a nurse, for instance.)  Passion counts for a lot, so does talent.There are lots of ways and reasons to dance in life; nobody says you have to dance for your bread in order to fulfill your life's mission.  Oh -- and don't forget to enjoy yourself. =)  ","Hi, Im a 14 year old girl who started ballet a few months ago, 14 is VERY late to start ballet especially for a girl. I really want to make ballet a career in the future but today I feel so discouraged. My teacher basically tells us every class well never make it any farther than weve gotten already and tells us about how future professionals our age are already signed with companies, that if were not en pointe by 13 well go nowhere. Im basically having a breakdown right now after class and honestly feel like I should just quit even though I want nothing more in life then to dance. If any of you can give me any sort of encouragement or advice at all I would appreciate it so much. Thank you"
So happy for you even if just as friends. Just enjoy and remember it. Live in the moment!,I am about to ask a girl to prom wish me luck.

At the time, my car did not have AC and I had my son in the backseat taking him to daycare. I call my partner to inform him that I needed his help because my car was disabled. He asked me to drop a pin at my location and I did but it gave the incorrect address, so I gave him the actual address of where I was. Instead of coming to get me, he started to rant about not wanting to be on the road searching for me. I get irritated and curse at him and from then on he argued me to death about he is doing me a favor and that I shouldn't be talking to people in a certain way when I need something. He continued to refuse to come and get me and instructed me to find someone else to pick me up. When I did, he got upset that I even asked him and proceeded to argue with me for the rest of the day. During the arguments he stated that he wish he never met me and had a baby with me and stated that he wished his son was dead."

The workload and material aren't any more difficult than before, but I'm guessing the transition to a new school out of state and away from my family for the first time, in addition to being sick 5 times during the semester, has made it difficult. I have an A, Bs and a C in my other classes at the moment, but my current biology class is the only one I have an F in. I've never failed a class before and I'm trying my hardest to redeem myself and ace the last two exams, but my confidence is not there.

I can easily sit down in the morning and producing art until before bed, but when it comes to my own stuff, it's almost impossible to just sit down and finish projects, be it an artbook, a plot, a comic, a game... I always end falling back into drawing commissions or illustrations, which I can finish with ease.It seems so many gamedevs or comic artists finished projects by the time they were my age or just a bit younger. Shouldn't I have projects behind me and not just illustrations by now? I'm getting closer to finishing stuff, but while I suffer of a quarter life crisis I fear I will just get old too fast to get it all out. It's a scary thought... I sure hope my capacity to produce become exponential with time or rejuvenation therapies become mainstream or something, because the stress is not going to help me make a better product either"
Good vibes sent! Good luck OP! ,Send good vibes
Im sorry that I cant really give much advice. I just hope you can find some encouragement knowing that you arent alone in your fears. I feel the same way and Im scared that I wont ever find anybody who actually has feelings for me. The only advice I can give is keep pushing through. Im not going to try to tell you you wont face rejection and pain. The only thing you can really do is power through and better yourself. Dont give up!,"I've been reading some things on Reddit that have re-activated my fears of never getting a partner. It's like a massive weightful dread and sadness that I don't know what to do with. I looked up and found this subreddit because I feel like a withered plant who never got any masculine encouragement to try different risky things and take action despite fears, including talking to girls. And I feel starved for female attention as well, which creates a self-perpetuating cycle. I would love if I had men and women in my life who supported me with approaching people socially, either for romantic purposes or just trying crazy things. But most of the people around me seem anxious and not to know how to provide that sounding board. They wouldn't tell me to jump off a waterfall if it was actually safe and I was just scared.Another thing I could use encouragement on is a large project of mine, which I don't know how to start, because much of it requires social buy-in from others to get going. But also, in order for it to get going, it needs social buy-in. So I probably need to wait until I have more resources, but then there's this voice in my head saying ""why wait?"". So it's frustrating."
"I don't have any real advice, but I also struggle with this issue. Hugs from me to you. ","I just had a rather horrid binge, and this has been a problem Ive been dealing with ever since childhood.

"Hello internet friend. I just wanted to remind you that you are worthy of respect, love and affection just for being you. Sounds like this woman has no idea what she wants but her wishy-washiness isnt respectful of you. I get it, Im not down on her. She has her reasons. However, you dont deserve anything less than a hearty fuck yeah I want to be with you, whether it lasts or doesnt. Let this be a lesson to not allow someone to flirt without being honest about their feelings. You can always set a boundary of what you will and wont accept. Like if you want to be together cool, if not stop flirting, we are just friends. If it ruins a friendship then it ruins a friendship but often people will respect you more when you set a boundary. You got this!!!!","I guess Ill explain my situation. For about 3 months now Ive been talking to this girl. After our first date she said she didnt feel anything for me and so I tried to move on. After about a week of not talking to her she texted me asking how my day was. Since that day she started talking to me non stop every day. She then started to get kind of flirty and lead me on. When I talked to her about it, she said she was confused because she didnt feel anything originally and now she thinks things are changing. I was excited and so I just kept doing what I was doing and things were going great. Things went bad on Friday the 27th. The subject of our relationship status got brought up again and she said she was conflicted and part of her wants to just remain friends and part of her wants something more. I asked her if we could talk about it in person but we had to end up FaceTiming. It turns out all that flirting and leading on was her intentionally doing that to see if she was interested. What I took as affection turned out to be experimentation and at this point she was trying to avoid telling me the truth. Ive been rejected before but this one was different."

"Have you tried working for yourself; such as, walking dogs, house work, day care, odd jobs, etc. i know verbal abuse is hard. I lived with an ex who verbal abused everyday.

If you want change you will do anything to do it. Just remember YOU CAN DO THIS!!!!!! Believe in yourself and your not a failure. Everyone has failed.

Good luck!!,I am a struggling makeup student for 3 years and I finally got my first paid job for working on set for a short film. I was extremely anxious over it and stayed in a hotel for 4 days just to get some work experience which I never thought I could do this early on in my course. I did it and smashed it and I wasnt tagged in the promo post by the director who is also a student btw when he tagged everyone else. My parents werent too fussed either. I thought this was gonna be this massive achievement but now I feel like maybe I shouldnt feel so proud of myself as I am.
"Screw motivation. You are disciplined enough you can spend 20 minutes a day doing that. Treat yourself when you get to a few hours of drawing and get a nice sketch book. You got this. Baby steps. Now, make a list of all the stuff you wish, and see which ones you are willing to dedicate 20 minutes a day in pursuit of, and it will help. I repeat: You can do this. It is stupid easy.

I've been able to achieve many things and try to expand on my potential by fighting against this hate. And all I have gotten from my parents is the assurance that any success of mine was due to their constant encouragement. That's right all that bullshit talk and abuse they call encouragement and I've often even believed them. But I know it isn't true or I think I do. All the time I'd almost thought their shit hadn't affected me but it has. As I'm starting out my adult years I feel trapped and I feel like I'm slipping in the wrong direction. I'm having trouble socializing and succeeding in school and I really do feel like I'm an useless nothing. And that's where I need your help. I need encouragement. I need you help so that I can prove to myself that encouragement and love can carry me through. I basically just need someone to care because the only people who I have, have only been bringing me down. It feels good to get that off my chest. Thank you, reddit and if YOU need encouragement let me know cause I have some for you :)"
well part of a colleges point is to try out many different things and possible careers. whether you can handle the workload is more your call. If your using it as a coping mechanism then possibly but as coping mechanisms go its a rather productive one.   In my non professional personal opinion I doubt you will disappoint yourself by becoming more knowledgeable especially sense your not driving yourself into debt doing it. Honestly you have no obligation to finish any of the classes once you find something else that interests you so if you find something like work or a new hobby your in the free and clear.Many people use education to keep their minds fresh and sharp and honestly its rather admirable. Just remember to enjoy yourself and find your calling. once you find your calling you can use it to direct your education to where you want to go.     not sure if this helps but thats my opinion,"I'm struggling right now in many things. I have a bachelor of science in graphic design, but it's a popular career and I'm just not competitive enough. When my old job falsely accused me of assault, I got a certificate in technical writing to boost my chances at a new job. When I learned I might need to somehow move into a senior community to help out a friend, I got a certificate for in-home senior care so I could be his caretaker. Due to the pandemic, many certification classes are extremely cheap. So I picked up a photoshop class to boost my chances of a side job with graphic design even though the degree should technically cover it.Now I seem to have an ""addiction"" to getting more education and certificates. Im not spending $1000s of dollars for a class so its not like I'm ""spending money I don't have"". As I said, most of these classesare on sale due to schools trying to help either people who were laid off find new skills or people who are in quarantine find new hobbies, and they are usually between $10 and $25 each depending on the class.I ended up picking up classes to get certified in copywriting, dog training, and digital photography on top of what I mentioned above. I'm starting to regret picking up these new skills- like it feels like I'm trying to compensate or fill a void now.Am I biting off more than I can chew here? Am I doing too much? Is there such a thing as too much learning? Should I stop? I could just use a little direction and confirmation that this choice to learn more will not end up disappointing me in the future."

I've been on and off slightly sick for weeks, just body aches and fatigue that lasts only a day. Well, a few days ago I had that again, along with a minor fever, but this time the symptoms have lasted several days. It is totally bearable, but I am just feeling really emotional and tired of being sick. Today my fever is a little worse, and on top of that, I'm in grad school and my current class has us reading several readings a day plus long blog posts. I'm tired of having to read all day, write a long blog post, and being sick on top of that. I just want to lay in bed all day and relax, nap, and cry a little. I apologize if this post is too ""complain-y"" and I know there are much more important things in the world than me being tired of being sick. I am so thankful that I can do school from home and not have to go out for work, especially with the pandemic going on. I am also thankful that my symptoms are not as bad as many people right now, but I am also really scared that this might lowkey be covid and the symptoms will ramp up.

This begs some fundamental questions, where does your identity lie? What things are you putting your hope on? Weve seen and understood clearly nothing is permanent. This diminishing hope is very insecure and can cover our mind with anxiousness and fear. Its not a good place to be in when everything you trust in is fading away. Did you identify yourself with your job, were you putting trust in your friends all this time, did you make plans to save up on money for future?And what happens when these things are affected. Scary, right?Yes, a similar incident is what Im still going through. Ive been waiting since 3 years to join as a pilot in an airline.

You're tough as hell and done so much. Not to be platitude-y but it seems like you can do anything you set your mind to!

I'm not happy with this but I can't do anything about it because I work remotely from home as a contract employee. But today's email tells me that all of my accounts are being deactivated to ""save money"" and that he hopes the team can get up and functional again in January and he hopes I'll be part of the team then.So I'm essentially now unemployed for all of December which means Christmas is going to suck even more than usual, and I'm probably going to spend the next couple of weeks struggling with the heavier bouts of depression and anxiety again.I've been applying for jobs both remote and local for two months now and I haven't gotten anything, no bites at all.

"You know it is possible, but you do not have access to it at the moment because of the resistant energy. It is frustrating. But this is all part of your creative process. I believe, if you approach your situation with patience and understanding, you may be able to better understand where you are at right now. From there you will know exactly what to do. But you must approach with care, and no expectations of yourself. Expectations create pressure, and pressure creates more resistance.

"Hey Tunapower. Sorry to hear things are feeling so stressful. It can be really hard to see past the current debris in those kinds of situations. Its important to let yourself express your emotions and your feelings, whether with someone or alone. Dont hold those things inside, be as courageous as you can and allow yourself to genuinely emote.","Hi reddit, I'm in serious need of some encouragement words or some advice. Anything will do really. I'm not very good at this but let's give it a try.I'm 24, recently had to quit my job in order to finish my thesis and being able to get my fucking college degree. My Job was very stressful but it was my only source of income, I think I made the right decision by quitting but I'm in a tough spot right now.As you can imagine, working on a thesis is no easy feat and as of this moment I feel incredibly anxious, depressed and overwhelmed. I'm short of time and even shorter on motivation and willingness to live. I have no other income than my savings and I'm living with my parents. I also have to spend ALL the fucking day alone, working on my thesis and taking care of myself.I just don't know what to do anymore and it is only making me more anxious and overwhelmed. If maybe some of you could give me some advice or encouraging words, that would be great!Thank you so much for reading."
"First, please hang in there. Things will get better. Being 14 is can be very difficult and confusing. If your friend is overreacting that way to specific jokes about you harming yourself, its probably because they care about your well-being. Its too much responsibility for a friend to have to talk you down from those close calls or not knowing the difference from a call for help and a joke. Theyre not trained professionals and this can be really stressful/scary for them, hence overreacting.",my friend told me to stop and I did but now I feel like doing it again and I dont know what to do....I cant tell anyone about it because Im afraid they will try to help or even judge me. Im not the perfect 14 year old girl my parents want me to be..I dont have good grades I cant stay focused but Im trying so hard but seem to accomplish absolutely nothing....Im just ranting about half of my problems that Im probably overthinking but yea sorry if i wasted anybodys time sorry for ranting....
"You just got your heart fixed. Don't let her heartless ways break it. Get stronger because right now your body needs you, and you can provide the nurturing it needs right at this time. Life's a series of unfortunate timing and events, its all about how we get through it. And its fine if your process is a lil messy, but do it after your heart feels physically nurtured by you. You got too far already, lets go!",Thank you all for your kind words.
Oh wow! That's amazing! You are so brave!,"Just need a little encouragement. A man threatened suicide when I told him I no longer wanted to date. I helped him get help and when I thought the situation deescalated, I left. He since has sent numerous texts and emails. Finally (much, much later when I thought this was over) he sent a 4-page letter to my house claiming that I caused all of the anxiety, depression, and desire to end it all. I filed a PFA (protection from abuse) against him. He is an abuser and its going to take a lot to be in the same room as him tomorrow - and to listen to him make up his version of reality, and to fight the protection I am seeking.I am hoping against hope that the judge believes me and is willing to grant this order to give me some peace of mind.UPDATE: abuser tried to outright lie and say I kept coming to his building so HE now wanted an order against ME. My incredible lawyer was not having any of that - and I was granted the order. Thank you everyone for your encouragement. I am so relieved"
"I'm so sorry things are tough right now. I wish I could give you a big hug. I hope things turn around soon for you. Something that helps me when things are tough is to find one thing (big or small) that I enjoy, and do that. For me right now, it's baking. But maybe you like coloring, or reading, or talking to your family on Skype. Maybe finding something you find joy in and have access to might lift your spirits just a bit. I hope this helps.","Ive been having toenail issues for about a year now, which tops it off for the head to toe partIm unemployed right now and couldnt get unemployment, so thats really rough.

"I feel you, dear. 30 years old and had that happen to me last year. The harder higher you feel from someone the harder you fall. I promise you time will give you your love back.

"I just want to add that I've been so happy with the type of responses I've received from the reddit community as a whole. I haven't posted much but have gotten great feedback, for the most part.","My wife and I recently moved to be closer to her family to help with childcare. I was making $40,000+/yr at a restaurant.  I've worked in restaurants most of my life and have truly come to hate it. So with the move, I decided to try to do something different.  So I got a job in a completely different industry and now only make $15.50/ hr, about $30,000/yr. My wife just got a job making $13/hr.  I'm struggling seeing us making enough money to obtain our goals. We are currently living with her parents. We have two kids and the oldest will be starting preschool in a year or two. We still need to get another car for myself that's big enough for all four of us.  And we really want to start thinking about buying our first house instead of renting. Are we going to be OK? Can someone just call me crazy and say it's going to work out?My wife's reaction was to start yelling that this is why she hates being with me.  Nothing is ever good enough for me and I'm incredibly hard on my self because I want to be and to give my kids everything I didn't have.  And I don't think I'll be able to with only $15/ hr."
"Just ask yourself, ""Why do I sing?""  If the answer is, ""Because I love to sing,"" then it doesn't matter who hears you, right?  For the sake of argument, consider the worst-case scenario ... what happens if they say something bad about your singing?  Would that stop you from loving it?  I'd bet it would make you more determined to do your best.The best-case outcome is more likely: either they'll be supportive (because it sounds like you're keeping your talent to yourself), or they'll quietly let you do your thing.  Our fears are only shadows ... they aren't real.Fear is the opposite of love.  There's only space in your heart one or the other -- so choose the one that empowers you to be yourself.  Sing like nobody can hear you, u/DaraMurray.  Never be afraid to take a chance. =)","i really need some help. my family is home, and i normally sing alone. i really want to sing but as soon as i do, i feel really paranoid and anxious that they will say something. &amp;#x200B;i just wanna be able to play my guitar and sing, right now. and not care about anything."
Thank you for the awesome encouragement and comment! !!,"I'm 19, I weigh 235 lb I used to be 250 at the beginning of the year, but it's really hard to keep exercising.

You sound stuck. Maybe try out counseling? Even just one of the apps on your phone could help. Some of them have affordable options.,I just fucking hate everything; I dont know what to do and I dont know how long Ill be like this. Nothing ever gets better and Im so sick of life
"But eventually, as hard as it is, I need to accept that I am not perfect and that beating myself up inside doesn't help me or the people I care about.

Im sorry youre going through this.  I dont think I will though. I know I need to talk this out with a professional, but I cant afford that or the insurance to cover it. Its cruel how the world keeps on going after your own world lies in ashes at your feet. Tbh, I feel empty inside. I have for quite a while now. Thats not really the truth though. I do feel something.

You got this! Its so worth it and youve done so many great things! Reach out if you need some help.

"Hey friend. Im sorry you have to deal with this. I hope youre able to feel better soon. Do seek a therapist if you feel this way. I also want to say that Im glad you exist. I know it may not seem like it, but you do have an impact on the world. By existing, you are affecting whats happening in the world, even if it is just in your small community.","I need some help. I'm having a lot of trouble mentally and don't want to burden friends and family with my issues. I don't want to burden anyone really. But I guess strangers are better in this scenario.

I'm not remarkable. I'm not going to change the world (although that's what I thought I was suppose to do). At best I will live an average normal existence.

Sometimes, every so often, I am actually happy. I think. But the demons always come back. I'm so tired of living this way. It effects every facet of my live. I've lost jobs, friends, relationships etc. It seems the only way to keep the demons away is to just cease to be here.  I've had another fairly bad episode this past week and I'm worried about my job. I'm worried about what my coworkers think. I'm worried about pretty much everything to be honest. The list is endless. I guess what I'm asking is for some comforting words of encouragement that everything won't implode and even if it does it won't always be that way."
"Nurture you. When you do that, not only will you have a fuller life than you imagined and more potential loves interested in you than ever before, but you'll also have a strength and self reliance that will help you cope with any situation in the future. Life can be full of difficulty sometimes, but don't let that blind you to all that you have going for you. Keep working at it, keep inviting new ways to care for yourself into your life, and I'll wager that you will look back on this relationship and find that you've outgrown it.

The rest of my high school experience was much better, but I eventually chose to get a GED instead of graduating traditional high school.

It's what it's there for, and anyone you talk to would for sure have better advice than I would.

I have a bachelor of science in graphic design, but it's a popular career and I'm just not competitive enough. When my old job falsely accused me of assault, I got a certificate in technical writing to boost my chances at a new job. When I learned I might need to somehow move into a senior community to help out a friend, I got a certificate for in-home senior care so I could be his caretaker. Due to the pandemic, many certification classes are extremely cheap. So I picked up a photoshop class to boost my chances of a side job with graphic design even though the degree should technically cover it.Now I seem to have an ""addiction"" to getting more education and certificates. Im not spending $1000s of dollars for a class so its not like I'm ""spending money I don't have"". As I said, most of these classesare on sale due to schools trying to help either people who were laid off find new skills or people who are in quarantine find new hobbies, and they are usually between $10 and $25 each depending on the class.I ended up picking up classes to get certified in copywriting, dog training, and digital photography on top of what I mentioned above. I'm starting to regret picking up these new skills- like it feels like I'm trying to compensate or fill a void now.Am I biting off more than I can chew here? Am I doing too much? Is there such a thing as too much learning? Should I stop? I could just use a little direction and confirmation that this choice to learn more will not end up disappointing me in the future."

So I go, not far from home but not close either, 16 years old moving out when all youve known and seen is your hometown is scary and it took a while but I got used to it, but there I just felt even though their trope was that you could fit in anywhere, I felt more alien than ever before and not myself, I loved off my humour and cracking jokes and being a spastic making people laugh and to be in a place where I felt I was alone but had so many people around me living along side them, it just didnt fit, now people got used to each other people made friends and so did I but I just felt alien to everyone else, now I do have things Im proud of in there, I picked up an injury so missed a lot of lessons so having picked up a rifle for the first time on a Wednesday and having to take it into a test and passing first time on a Friday was something I was surprised i was good at, a zooming through an obstacle course as the others looked on shocked on how good and fast I was getting through it was a feeling Id never felt before, but I knew it wasnt right and at least wasnt the right time, so I left halfway through training."

We all do","Like I said before I really honestly do wanna work, I want to have a career I really do. I know there's ODSP (disability) here in Canada but I honestly don't wanna be on disability and I didn't wanna be on it in the U.S.A but I don't know what choice I have. I don't know if I'll qualify for ODSP here either or be told again that I'm not severe enough. I hope I don't get turned down for Ontario Works, I need that assistance. As a kid and teenager since I'm female I was taught by my parents that all I'll be good for is cooking, cleaning, and making babies and that's it. I just don't want that to be true. Sometimes though I wonder if it's true and I get depressed wondering that (I do have medical depression, anxiety, and seasonal affective disorder.) I would like to graduate high school but need money for the courses to do that and right now since I'm living below the poverty line I don't have that money, I choose to spend whatever cash I get on food because it's nice to eat."
I know this might not sound great to you right now but the key for me is to turn negative into a positive. Figure out how you can do that. Is it possible for you to get a second job maybe try something you've never tried before? Reading is a good start but that might not be enough to change your circumstances to get your mind off the negative enough maybe you should look into something a little bit more drastic.You really just try to stay busy at the end of the day. Staying busy is the key to fixing a lot of personal problems in my experience.If there is a project you were already working on double down on that.,"Hey guys, this isn't something I would usually do but I could really use some encouragement, or even tough love. My ex of about 2 years dumped me about 2 weeks ago, just in time for semester break, great. The relationship didn't end badly, but it did end and I feel very unsatisfied about it. -  I can provide details and explain why if anyone is interested.Anyway, I'm back in my parent's house for break (2 more weeks), they live in a small town, and there's pretty much nothing to do. I don't drink, smoke, or do any drugs like most people do to pass the time around here. My best friend left back to the Army this morning, who knows when I'll get to see him again, and I don't really have much other friends around here. I find myself doing nothing but thinking about her and it really sucks; I'm miserable and sometimes the only thing that cheers me up is the thought that maybe she'll regret it one of these days, call me, and we'll get back together. However, today is the day she goes on vacation to mexico. She'll be surrounded by her supporting family all day for the next 2 weeks, I won't even be on her mind and it scares me; any realistic hope I had of us patching things up and getting back together begins to fade now, forever. I'm not completely distraught or taking it so bad that I'm thinking suicide, no way. But, it totally hurts; she's the first girlfriend I could say I sincerely loved.To get my mind off of her and just become a better man, I've committed to some changes in my life like reading every night, eating healthy, and working out. Those things have been helping but I still face a lot of downtime. I could really use some encouragement dudes and gals, and some suggestions on how to get over her or keep me busy in such a small town. Thank you :)"

"You have a good head on your shoulders.  You're keeping yourself and your son safe and that's important.  Its ok to be sad when any relationship ends.  Good or bad, short or long.  Take care of yourself.   It sounds like you already know how to do that.  :)  I know from experience that there is a huge sense of relief when you leave an abusive relationship so hang onto that.  You already made the hardest decision by leaving and now you have a bright new path before you.  It can seem scary, but isn't it exciting too?!  I know someone here already said this, but if you need to talk or vent, please pm me.  Good luck!  You got this!","I recently ended a relationship with my partner he is 28 and I am 32. We've been in a relationship for 3 years and I'm feeling down about it and I don't know why. This relationship has been an entire roller coaster from the start. I met my partner in 2016 and things moved very swiftly. So swiftly, that I ended up pregnant. This pregnancy was mutual and we both wanted a long-lasting fruitful relationship, so I thought. I was determined to do better and make this my last relationship but things quickly turned for the worst.Here are some situations:&amp;#x200B;Incident 1\-Boyfriend was in Miami for his birthday since we could not go on our trip to Mexico together.

"Ok I want to recommend some things: Try taking care of your body. Go eat some food, drink water, take a shower, take your meds. It's important. If you're looking for a reason to live, try the suicide hotline. At least try it before you do anything serious. It's what it's there for, and anyone you talk to would for sure have better advice than I would. If you're looking for unconditional love, all I can say is that the only unconditional love I've ever found came from Jesus. Best decision I ever made was to accept it. The future is not hopeless and you are not worthless.","I trusted her promise to me. I have had only heartache for many years while trying to find someone to be with. I get hurt each time I let my heart believe. This time its different, I truly love her like no other before and I want to be with her, to help support her to help he with the stress of life, to be her partner in life. I want to go to sleep with her in my arms and wake up and her be the first thing I see in the morning. I want to do all the things we talked about doing, the bucket list of family adventures.I dont know that I will get over this breakup, not even sure it would be called a breakup more like a harsh dump from her. I am of no value anymore, I don't even have enough value to say goodbye to. I only desired to be wanted, someone who would want to be with me, who wanted me to be part of their life, someone who loved me. Unconditional love, a love that is true.I want to die right now, and I hate myself for going that direction."
"Life is always going to have some rough patches. No matter what. But you have to let yourself move through those situations, don't get stuck recycling old thoughts/judgements people make, don't be afraid to reach out to the people in your life, and try to focus on what is in your control to change. Do you need to hang out with different people who aren't tearing you down and making you feel negatively about yourself and school?","I wake up at 6:00 AM only to go to a Place where I'll never feel like I'm good enough at anything.

"I can relate to the self-loathing, too. Somehow with practice, I got to a nice place of accepting myself. It takes practice. I changed some things about my physical body and changed my mind instead on other things. Physical and mental self-care is something I still struggle with, but when I muster up the patience to commit to it in ""manageable chunks"", it's left me feeling much, much better about myself.

Ghosted by my college friends when I had a family medical emergency and had to withdraw from school, and my best friend blocked me on everything in December.

Its cruel how the world keeps on going after your own world lies in ashes at your feet. Tbh, I feel empty inside. I have for quite a while now. Thats not really the truth though. I do feel something. Fear. Im afraid of losing those I care about. Im afraid that Im not good enough.

I want to thank you guys for commenting and encouraging me. Ive read your comments many times over the last few days. It has been awhile since I have felt like anyone was rooting for me.  Thank you.,"Tried to go back to warehouse work but the pain in my legs, feet, hips and back was excruciating. Only lasted 3 months. Husband was the bread winner and I did literally everything else. All he had to do was bring home a check. I scheduled appointments, paid bills, cleaned the house, planned meals, grocery shopped, etc. I was already doing that while also working. It was nice to only do one side of it. We bought a house. 1 month later my husband lost his job of 7 years. In the 2 years since, he has worked a total of 5 months. We cashed out his 401k. It lasted a year. I tried another call center. Cried so they let me go. We don't have the money for food, but Im trying to eat right and exercise anyways. Husband refuses to work. He won't clean. He won't talk to me about our future. He won't get his driver's license. Still wants sex though, even though it's painful to me and I need to see a gyno. Im happy he still wants me. Im afraid he will stop one day. Im still doing everything."

"Cultivating deep friendships can feel like a huge task. I had this struggle when coming to college for the first time, away from the solid group of people I'd been around my entire life. But this could be a season where you focus on finding out more about yourself. Sometimes in the moments you're alone you grow deeper in understanding the type of person you are and what you want out of life, what you're called to do. This might help when venturing out. Seeking security in being okay by yourself (just for a little while) will help when those friendships you are going to make go deeper.","Been here 6 months but have no close friends, just had a hard week with a particularly disappointing dating rejection after a long month with difficulty sleeping.

"hello, fellow Canadian here. Close to Toronto. I can understand how frustrating this is for you and I am sorry you are going through this alone. I am not in a similar position but I am sure there are lots of people in the same position as you. You are right about the current state of the systems here in Canada, the minimum wage workers can not afford to live and this entire country is car dependent. And yes Covid is reeking havoc on mental health all over the world. It is hard, really hardAll I can say is that ""this too shall pass"" That is a quote from a Buddhist monk. So right now everything sucks and you are suffering but it will (eventually) pass and you will start to see the light againKeep pushing and looking for new ways to make life better, I know it hard but that is all we can do &lt;3","I'm really scared living in Canada and being poor and mentally ill.I suffer from neurological and mental disorders and have always had trouble keeping work. I'm in an affordable city ( Montreal ) but really want to go, but everywhere I look it all seems even more expensive than it was.Toronto is not doable, Hamilton has gone up a lot too. I could really only afford a shared apartment on minimum wage ( if I could keep the job ) and disability isn't enough for a 1 bedroom either. Living with others can be very stressful, of course not as stressful as being homeless, I know I was once for a short time.I just feel so depressed being poor and mentally ill in Canada, like the raising rent and costs of food, ect makes it no longer a place for poor people, minimum wage workers. I'm just alone in this big city, no license, no job, and the Covid19 situation makes it hard for me to connect to communities, to feel like I have a future. There are only a few places left that are affordable for low income people in Canada, and those places have high unemployment and are car dependent. I guess I wish I knew someone who was struggling financially and mentally ill, I'm so alone and scared in my own country."

Although my mania has subsided, Im still convinced that my idea is worthwhile, so Im not going to reveal the specifics. Sorry.I was so overwhelmed with excitement, that I went to my friends apartment to share the idea with them.

I'm having an extremely difficult time coming to terms with the idea that she isn't the one.Throughout asking for help introspective and reflective application essays, I've realized that my parents barely know me. In their attempts to help me with my break-up, they default to useless lessons in Christianity, which I ignore because I am not a Christian. However, my parents don't know this. I've refrained from telling them out of fear of being disowned. My reluctance to reveal this has led to me being the worship leader for my school's Christian organization (along with the fact that I'm the only person in my school who can sing and play guitar). My ex-girlfriend is the only person who knows I'm not Christian. I plan to tell my parents when I get to college, and don't have to live under their roof anymore.I'm hoping that college will be a new start for me, where I can actually be honest and connect with other people, but for the next few months, I'm alone and stressed.

I'm not going to change the world (although that's what I thought I was suppose to do). At best I will live an average normal existence. I hate that in order to even remotely be alright I have to take medication for the rest of my life. Anxiety and depression overwhelm my life.

Sometimes, every so often, I am actually happy. I think. But the demons always come back. I'm so tired of living this way. It effects every facet of my live. I've lost jobs, friends, relationships etc. It seems the only way to keep the demons away is to just cease to be here.  I've had another fairly bad episode this past week and I'm worried about my job. I'm worried about what my coworkers think. I'm worried about pretty much everything to be honest. The list is endless.

When I learned I might need to somehow move into a senior community to help out a friend, I got a certificate for in-home senior care so I could be his caretaker. Due to the pandemic, many certification classes are extremely cheap. So I picked up a photoshop class to boost my chances of a side job with graphic design even though the degree should technically cover it.Now I seem to have an ""addiction"" to getting more education and certificates.

As I said, most of these classesare on sale due to schools trying to help either people who were laid off find new skills or people who are in quarantine find new hobbies, and they are usually between $10 and $25 each depending on the class.I ended up picking up classes to get certified in copywriting, dog training, and digital photography on top of what I mentioned above. I'm starting to regret picking up these new skills- like it feels like I'm trying to compensate or fill a void now.Am I biting off more than I can chew here? Am I doing too much?

The realization that a new human being -- their well-being, education, role-models, their entire future! -- depends on you *should* be a life-changing experience.

"Hugs. Remember that sometimes you have to take life five minutes at a time. If you try to solve all the problems at once, it gets super overwhelming.","Hi all, Im 22 and Im stressed out. Admittedly I thrive in tense and high stress situations. I come from a conservative, Christian, middle class family in PA.  Im an only child and I still live at home. I dont have my own car and Im one year out from finishing my degree. I decided to join the Army National Guard to find my last year of college. Times are getting rough at home. Parents are done paying for school, rightfully so, but refuse to co-sign on any loans. Knowing this, I enlisted into the Guard. Well two days before I was supposed to ship for Basic Training I found out I was pregnant. The man isnt my official boyfriend, we have been involved for over a year but we got back together after a big break up, just never officially stated were bf/gf. My parents dont approve, mostly because I painted him in a bad light to them and theyre stuck on me dating someone who fits in more with our family. They refuse to let me use any of their cars to drive to see him, and insist he picks me up. Well, at some point in time, eight weeks ago, I got pregnant. When I didnt get my period, but still felt like I was having cramps, I thought nothing of it."

Good luck","TL:DR at bottomFor 16 years Ive been alive and most of it I loved. Only when I left my house that is, I have a single mother parent who emotional abuses me calling it parenting. I tell her I love you so I can get alone time (I dont actually mean it) if I dont say anything to her she goes off ranting through out the house and calls relatives to give them false stories, I thinks, and so forth thinking her assumptions are correct. Its gotten to the point that the only things keeping me sane at this point are my two little brothers knowing if she does kill me (shes held knifes and hammers to my head and neck) my little brothers will have nowhere secure to go to. Im starting to crack under the pressure I just need people to talk to.TL:DR Im a victim of emotional abuse under the disguise of parenting and the only thing keeping me together is my brothers. All I want is someone to talk to"
"School drains energy and passion from people - But whoever tells You those are the best years of Your life is lying. The only advantage of being in school is only additional time You might have so You should use it to best extent, finding hobby for example.

Creating things can be uplifting, even if nobody sees them but you. It's freeing, and can give you a sense of accomplishment.This is my first time offering encouragement here - so please forgive me if whatever I say seems ambiguous or misguided.

And hes part of ROTC!! The sun shines a little brighter when he wears the ROTC army uniform ,"Ive been feeling kinda down and ugly lately. If you check my profile, you would see that a lot of the recent stuff I posted is similar in idea. I really want to talk to my crush but it would never work out because hes way out of my league. And Im serious. He plays baseball so hes fit, hes super super smart (AP classes! And he never does the precalc hw but he does great every test), hes humble (when I told him I got a hundred on my English midterm, he seemed genuinely happy even thought hes in much higher level classes than me), and hes fairly attractive.Ugh, hes probably the most mischievous little person around his friends and then hes nice- almost shy- with people that arent his friends.  And his face turns bright red, its adorable. He would never like me back. My friends say Im pretty but I think theyre lying. Im not the dumbest (my precalc grade would argue otherwise) and Ill admit Im in honor classes and Ive got a poem published in a book but thats about it. I try to stay fit too so its not like, health wise, were super different. I dont think it could ever work out anyways and I dont think his friends would approve of him dating me and I also think that  he would probably go chase the pretty girls that are also in the AP classes and equally as smart as him. I dont know what to do anymore. Hes all this cool stuff and Im just me and I wish he wasnt so out of my league. Im 16 btw if that changes anything "
Keep ur chin up youre doing fine. You cant choose your circumstances in life but u can choose how u live ur life. I'll be pulling for ya,"I've lived my entire life with shit being thrown at me. My parents/family and almost my culture are somehow very confused about encouragement and are often very absolved by cynicism and bullshit in the way they interact with people.(Example: While being in a soccer game at the age of 11, my team was losing very badly and as I looked out to the bleachers for some encouragement I heard my family laughing at me and shaking their heads saying how useless I was. The rest of the parents would yell things like ""Good try!""""You can do it!"" and ""It's all about having fun."") This is a lighthearted example but i have been basically bullied by my family since I was young. I've always been kind of chubby and when I was 7 years old my mom told me that if she was me, she'd just kill herself of how ugly and fat I was. I've been called useless and trash and just a few minutes ago my dad told me to keep wasting the little bit of shitty life I have left. This is something that I've been dealing with all of my life during any interaction with my family whatsoever. Noting that I've just moved away for college a year ago, that's 18 years of this. College? What? You'd think that I was an useless evil bum with all the lovely commentary I've provided."
"Sorry, I know this is over two months old, nearly. But yes. Dreams can happen. I never realized how  slowly they happen, but they do happen.A few years ago my typical day was wake up, play on the computer, go to school, do homework, computer, sleep, repeat. It was monotone and boring and pointless, but now I actually do things I care about. So maybe it aint the dream! Where Im in a mansion and I have a degree in astrophysics or whatever, but this is way more than what I could have imagined a few years ago.Keep dreaming, and dont give up because it gets better :)",Has anything lived up to your hopes and expectations ?It seems like the dream is better Is the best part of life fictional?
"It seems like you need to be alone for a while and concentrate on you.Do you have schools in line yet? Have you heard from them as far as scholarships(or have you even applied for them)? College is just another step of the stairs of life- it's not the be-all or end-all. If you don't get a scholarship, you will survive and still be happy. If you don't get into the college of your choice- you can choose to go elsewhere and be happy or wait another semester, etc. You have CHOICES and can make your life what you want.When you go to college, you'll be able to explore who you are more and find better like-minded people.","Lately I've been feeling really shitty. I'm a senior in high school, and I'm on my way to being valedictorian, which is great, but I feel under a lot of pressure to win a ton of scholarships and get into some fantastic school. I have practically no support, as my friends just assume that I'm some genius, rather than a hard worker, and I would feel strange complaining about good grades. I recently broke up with my girlfriend of a year and a half, and I've been so active that I feel like I haven't had any time to get my mind straight. She was one of the few people I really connected with, and I had been planning my whole future around the idea of us being together, so now I'm chugging along with no clear destination. I'm having an extremely difficult time coming to terms with the idea that she isn't the one.Throughout asking for help introspective and reflective application essays, I've realized that my parents barely know me. In their attempts to help me with my break-up, they default to useless lessons in Christianity, which I ignore because I am not a Christian. However, my parents don't know this. I've refrained from telling them out of fear of being disowned. My reluctance to reveal this has led to me being the worship leader for my school's Christian organization (along with the fact that I'm the only person in my school who can sing and play guitar). My ex-girlfriend is the only person who knows I'm not Christian. I plan to tell my parents when I get to college, and don't have to live under their roof anymore.I'm hoping that college will be a new start for me, where I can actually be honest and connect with other people, but for the next few months, I'm alone and stressed. I could really use some kind words/good advice, r/encouragement.TL;DRStressed by senior year, emotional over break-up, lying about Christianity. Help?"

I won't bore you with the details, but money is one of them.I cannot get a second job at this time, so I have been trying to find some ways to make passive income to supplement my budget and pay down my bills a little faster. I'm not looking for a get-rich-quick scheme, just a little financial help in a time of struggle.But I'm not really all that talented. I am considering writing a few short children's books complete with pictures and self publishing on Amazon. Again though, not exactly Stephen King or JK Rowling here.Here's an excerpt of one I wrote so far:""There once was a little dragon in my house.I found him when he was befriending a mouse.He seemed friendly, so I gave him a book.And together we loved to bake and cook.He washed his tail, teeth, and scalesAnd slept in a bed with blankets of redHe woke up at the crack of dawnTo watch the sunrise on the lawnThe little dragon loved shiny thingsLike watches, coins, and diamond ringsA necklace chain he would claimA jewel shard he would guard""What do you think?

I turn 20 literally on Friday and the fact that Im 20 with no stable income and barely getting by is killing my motivation and the way I want to handle things in life. I just feel like I have nothing going for me anymore. The only thing I can say Im motivated about is starting up my own kicking camp to teach high school football kickers the most important techniques and tips for training and in game situations. Besides that I cant find something to hold on to that would keep my head high and keep my motivation running.

"My feedback...What you are doing is essentially trying to start your own business. As with any entrepreneur, it is a lot of hard work (especially upfront).

A good word I like is hope. It is a good word that helps a lot of us in hard times,"Hey, y'all. I have been fighting depression and self hate for a while. Someone shared a video that encouraged me to try and be positive, despite my faults. I have a therapist and some people IRL I can talk to, but wanted to join some groups here on reddit for some encouragement. If ya got a good word (other than ""Bird"", please share it. Thanks and safe travels."
"I take comfort from the fact that life is always changing, and this is just a really big set of changes that everyone's paying attention to. No one's life ever stays the same. Friends come and go, people you care about get lost. There are new positives, new negatives, new stresses, and new strengths to discover.","I know a lot of people are in the same place and some even worse. Right now, Im finding it extremely difficult to get used to this new way of life, and I could use some encouraging words to push forward through this."
"It hurts my heart to read this - I can't even imagine what you're going through. I'm not a counselor, but I want to help you however I can. So ... hang in there! There are still lots of good people in the world. It sounds like your family loves you, and that's a good thing in your corner. If discussing your illness stresses them out, it's because they care about you.If I can offer any advice or encouragement, it's this: Recognize the times/situations where you sabotage yourself. This is a challenging area for me, personally.","My sister in law expressed that she wanted me out last night. After they encourage me to go to my best friend's wedding in another state and get involved in a local sport (which cost money), I was informed that she was pissed that I had bought sports equipment the other night and that it was becoming time for me to leave. She wasn't mean about it. She just stated that it was time for her to have her space back. I'm worried that after all the changes I have been making, I'm back where I started. I'm in a job that can't sustain me financially. I don't know how I'm going to afford my bills if I move out by February. I know that I can't work any more than 4 days a week with my current class load and my mental health issues. I can't get treatment now because I can't afford to pay for it. And I'd be lying if I didn't say I feel like the rug has been pulled from out beneath me. Maybe they thought I was doing better than I was actually doing. The truth is that talking about my illness stresses out my SIL. My brother offered to listen but every time I try to talk to him he just walks away. So I've only been telling them good things."
"I'm so sorry you're going through all of this! I'm not sure of the military process but don't give up hope! Even if this doesn't work out just know that this moment and situation is not forever. It can be tough to see the light at the end, but your light will come! I'm not here to judge you on your decisions or actions because we have all made mistakes or bad decisions. It's tough to face a difficult situation but this makes you stronger and you will get through this. ","I taught part time at a school and they insisted on collecting my bi-monthly $145 checks. I work at a gym but all that money goes into gas for my car since I drive to school. Parents pay the car payment and insurance. They control my clothing, friends, dating, phone calls, monitor everything about me, read my diary, create fake instagrams to stalk me. They tell me Im a child, and not an adult until my father walks me down the aisle to my husband someday. Mother says she sees me the same as when I was 15. I have phone recordings of them cursing me out and calling me names.( Im a fifth avenue slut for not having more jobs and for dating when I should be working 16 hours/6 days a week as a young able bodied woman.) I have 3 jobs, I go to college full time, and Im in the military. Im sorry I got pregnant. Im sorry I chose to terminate the baby, but I couldnt possibly bring a child into a situation that I dont even feel safe in. I felt that I had no other options. Please encourage me."

You will be a success.,"Tried to go back to warehouse work but the pain in my legs, feet, hips and back was excruciating. Only lasted 3 months. Husband was the bread winner and I did literally everything else. All he had to do was bring home a check.

But my husband still thinks I'm the sexiest woman on the planet. I don't know how. But he does. The point is, you are your own worst critic. And you've gotta learn to love yourself for who you are, and not what you see in the mirror or what hear come out of your mouth.

"Love, it hurts! You are making hard choices for a better future! You can stay strong, and keep trying! ","Arguing with me over not answering his phone calls when he thought I should, questioning my whereabouts and who I was hanging out with, and arguing with me about how I was disrespectful to him because I made a sarcastic joke or telling me that my facial expressions and tone of voice was disrespecting him, he would blow this out of proportion and make it seem like I'm antagonizing him, when I was just responding to a question he was asking. I asked him how was my tone and he couldn't tell me.&amp;#x200B;The recent dispute happened when I told him he could not have $1000 from my refund check. I did tell him yes earlier in the month, but after thinking and reconsidering his actions and everything that I have endured like paying for daycare for the past 3 months, and finding out he was going to party instead of working like he told me, I decided that I was not handing over any money to him. I cautioned myself and explained to him, I can't give the $1000 because I do not have means to do so right now. He went ballistic and basically told me that I put him in debt by throwing him in jail and after all the things he has done for me--I can't help him out. He goes on and says, you've been holding out on me and you weren't going to give me the money anyways. Then he tells me we should just take care of our son. I snap and say- that's fine, I don't want to be with you anymore while were at it."
"Hey! You made it this far due to your diligence! Please dont let one or 2 bad grades define whats ahead. Take some time (even for an hour or 2) to relax and do something that is fulfilling to you because I dont think pushing yourself even more is the best strategy right now. Its much easier to focus when youre well rested. Drink lots of water and get some fresh air and pick up where you left off. From a stranger on the Internet, I believe in you! You got this.","Hey everyone, hope you're doing well in these trying times.I'm just really upset because I have a 58 in my calc midterm.

Not what I dreamed of or anywhere near it and I'm not getting those jobs either, they keep asking for experience and a high school diploma. Even the fast food joints are doing that, which I think is stupid. What experience does someone need in order to ask the question ""do you want fries with that?""

Maybe you were even inspired by my encouragements.Well, today Im gonna need some of that.You see, I failed my last test. I thought I did very well on it but I actually got one of the lowest grades in the class.I talked to the professor about it and my professor asked if I was paying attention in class because he thought I might be multitasking. He told me some of the answers to the questions from the test were literally from the lecture. And he was right I was multitasking during lectures. Stupid of me right?I just feel like I cant recover from this. I feel like I cant pass this class. Im not even sure I can even finish my major.To sum it up, my confidence has been completely destroyed. I really struggle with believing myself.I was just wondering if any of you could help me.  Im not asking for much. A kind phrase will help. Maybe a bit of advice on how to navigate this class. Maybe a story of your own. Honestly anything helps. Thanks in advance."
"And that's absolutely alright. Self care is going to feel difficult, I absolutely understand that. Everything feels bleak right now, but it won't feel that way forever.

On top of that, her mental health has been beyond terrible for herwhich is likely a huge driving force for the dependencyand Ive gotten Caregivers Fatigue 3 or 4 times already. I desperately want to communicate this issue but she can already read it off of me (been together for a long time) which is making her mental health worse at times, and I think if we were to outright have that conversation it would cause her mental health to be even worse. She also gets upset that it seems like I view her as helpless and unable to function without me, and admittedly I do because shes so extremely needyI hate myself physically. Literally from my head to my toes: I cant find a good haircut and the barber that I helped out with that couldnt be consistent, then COVID hit and Im out a barber &amp; reference point for my hair.

You know when only *one* small thing goes wrong then suddenly youre all up in a rut about every life decision youve made? Well, Im feeling really shitty about the fact that technically I allowed two things of my own possession to get slightly damaged, all in one night. Due to being lazy in bed, I asked my dad to shake my lava lamp to let the floating hardened liquid to sink towards the bottom. He shook it too hard, causing the whole thing to fall apart and for the lightbulb to lose one of its connector pieces. He said hed go to the hardware store soon to replace the lightbulb, but Im in slight doubt if the lamp will work after that, feeling that its my fault, in technical aspects. This is going to also sound ridiculous, but my new phone (no case, no screen protector) somehow slid off the surface I placed it on while doing something this late at night, causing it to hit the hard floor screen first, getting itself some small scratches on its corners in the process. I know the scratches arent that bad, but my obsessive compulsive disorder really tests my tolerance when it comes to the smallest things. And it was a new phone that Ive only had for a couple of weeks, for crying out loud! Ive just been self deprecating for the past two hours, so far.In sum from all of this, how do I effectively diminish the thought of I could have done this to prevent this or that so I can learn from these small situations that have been bothering me for the past couple of hours? I guess I somehow have a compass as to how I can solve this, but hearing something from somebody else would really encourage me."

I have applied at some clothing stores, too, but they don't even call me for an interview. I am looking for a career, though, not a part-time job. I have also applied for key holders, reception, teaching (I have a TEFL certificate) , in theatre (I have a degree), but there are no call backs for me. I have 7 years landscaping with 2 of those as supervisor, and 1 being on my own. I don't have a degree in landscape design (just experience) nor do I have a florist certificate (which I am getting but it does cost almost 3300 CAD). I have had 2 interviews with a floral shop and a few via email and they always ghost me when they ask to see photos. I have tons of experience from landscaping making planters for all seasons. I also understand variety, textures, colours etc I am just bogged down by no one giving me a chance.

You're tough as hell and done so much. Not to be platitude-y but it seems like you can do anything you set your mind to!

"Sorry I am late on responding here. I thought I might be able to provide some insight.I once worked with a Fortune 100 Company that hired interns.

I also just got fired from my bartending job, which is 10 minutes from my house, but a friend of mine just got hired at a bar in St. Pete and said theyre looking for a female bartender, but I live with my boyfriend in Tampa, who is coincidentally  refusing to tell me whether he would be willing to move to St. Pete for me, saying thinking about it would just cause him unnecessary stress, that he doesnt need to think about it until the time comes.

I get so nervous that my mouth becomes dry, palms sweat, feet shake and I just cant get my mind straight. I am so mad because of that. I know that I have enough skill to pass the test but this nervousness gets the best of me. Please, encourage.Edit: thanks for kind words, everyone! I passed! I cant describe how helpful your kind words were. Thanks a lot! I am grateful to have Reddit installed on my phone, Jesus Christ. I can rest now."
"I know its a generic answer but you should think about seeing a doctor about this if this carries on. Your life doesnt have to be going bad to be depressed, it can happen to anyone. I really do hope you feel better but in the case that this doesnt change seek professional help. For the time being try to occupy your mind and distract yourself. Consider talking to your friends about it also, you might not think of it being that great but just talking about it to a friend is a great way to get stuff off of your shoulders.","Today just felt like the worst day ever. Nothing in particular bad happened everyone was in good spirits and happy but today Ive just felt awful. There are plenty of things that are going my way in life. I got accepted into my number one college, I start playing my favorite sport Monday, I have a very good group of friends and I have a decent job. But today I just couldnt shake the feeling of feeling depressed, hopeless, and just a waste of space. Ive been struggling to stay with school and feel that Im going down in all of my classes. Ive felt so short tempered and angry while also feeling extremely depressed and I just dont know whats wrong with me and why Ive felt so awful today."
"Hey Carbon, you sound really intelligent from how you write! You've got a plan towards your dreams, it just wasn't what you originally thought it was going to be. Life is like that sometimes. It takes a really strong person to stand up from failure and continue to persevere to their dreams. I believe in you and your capability to one day become a doctor. Nursing could also give you a unique perspective on medicine, which is something that will set you apart from other applicants when you decide to apply. You've got this! I'm cheering for you, and I am inspired by your ability to self reflect and move forward with a plan that you believe is right for you, regardless of the opinions of those who don't believe in you.","Which was a concern to me cause the test are not cheap and require a lot of studying that was not possible to do before the deadline for applications. What did the family think?:My parents are first gen Indians and so telling them, was not easy. All my life I chanted I was going to be a Doctor and even family friends and everyone essentially knew that I wanted to attend medical school and wanted to take care of all of them. My brother, lost hope in me. He often tell my friends and family he lost hope in me and didnt care where I ended up but labeled me as a failure. Often times telling them that all I did was go to college and party and waste my parents money. He was 2 ahead of me at the same university so he saw me hanging with the wrong crowd and I understand why he said what he said but he never really saw my progression or upward trend since then. We really dont talk but the occasional hi or hello."
That would be a great thing to do. Im sure many people would appreciate it. Can we consult you for fashion advice on Reddit?,"Hey everyone! So Im thinking of starting personal styling sessions via Skype! Is that something you would be interested in. E.g finding outfits to wear for special occasions, first dates, or just a general new look to boost confidence. I can find all the clothing items. Affordable to high end depending on request. I have a degree in fashion design and I work in fashion currently. Let me know if anyone is interested "
"I would suggest yoga. Yoga with Adriene is a favorite YouTuber. It's like by taking that time for you, you get a break from the world. And by doing it daily, you can do something you couldn't do last week, which really boosts your sense of control. The thing I know is that you are on your path. And if you notice the little things that light a flame of interest or joy, and follow them like a firefly in a summer night, they will lead you to answers. Be on the lookout for them.","Cooking, cleaning, planning meals, doing odd jobs for money. Ive lost everything it feels like but our room mate is covering us for now. I got us food stamps and medicaid and Im trying to get help, hence the diagnosis. Please don't harass me about being on snap, I don't want to be on it and they only give me 25$ a week. Have you ever tried to feed 2 adults on that amount? It's ramen and bread and my weight just stays the same. I lost weight on keto a few years ago. 50 lbs. It alleviated my pcos symptoms. I was so happy. But I can't afford it now. I keep trying. I know that I need to suck it up and suffer through. I know that I should eat eggs for every meal and canned tuna and lose the weight by sheer determination. I know that the pain in my hips and ankles is nothing and I should just walk through it. I know I should take a job and just grind it out every day. But when I think about the pain of that, I feel like giving up and dying. I just don't think that I can do it, or this anymore. I have plans to see a therapist. I have to ramp up to it. I make a bunch of calls and then I am burnt out and have to ramp up to it again. And yes, I know. I should just suck it up and call."

"There's always hope for everybody.Don't hurt yourself further by thinking you are not worthy of love. If you can pinpoint what you did wrong (if you did something wrong), you can find a way to fix it, if it is needed.If you take it easy and keep doing your best, things will fall into place.*It'll come a day you'll be able to laugh at the pain* is a very important sentence. Maybe not laugh, but find peace, understand, and even when it is a loss, gain something from it.Do what you need to keep your stress under control, distract yourself, let yourself heal and if it's too overwhelming, let yourself get distracted away from it, and let's see how things develop.","I [19F] just broke up with my boyfriend [22M] I am heartbroken and lost. I met him a couple months ago and I fell so hard and so fast for him. Now I dont have anything. I knew he was the one, I knew he would be the one who I would marry and be there till the end. I have messed up so bad and theres nothing I can do. I feel so hopeless.. I lost my soulmate, he was and still is my everything. I dont wanna live my life without him. I cant keep dealing with heartbreak. This has happened too many times. I cant do it. When Im heartbroken I get really bad depression. Im taking medicine for it but it still hurts. For once can I be treated right.. do I not deserve anything good in my life? Am I not deserving of love? Is there something wrong with me? Am I unloving..

a wise man once said its better to have a job you love with a low salary than a terrible high paying job. perhaps this isn't right for you!,"I'm feeling really low. A few months ago on I was promoted to my first management position. I was so excited to be In leadership and I really thought I could make a difference in someone's career. About 2 months ago I got my team, all new hires, and almost all straight out of  college with little or no job experience. They are so rough. After rigorous training almost all of them are rough, to be expected of course.What I wasnt expecting is to have 4 HR issues right of the bat and them escalating me to leadership above me. I have 3 that are are written warnings for attendance, 1 more and will be termed. 1 went to my leadership and asked if I was right. Unfortently I so know this may happen as people might be unhappy, especially if they are having performance issues. All day my leaders tell me that i have such a bad team and they feel so bad for me, that I'm doing great handling it and it's really breaking me in. I work in a corporate environment so it's very tricky to fire someone. This can be hard bc I'm in need to make an example of so.eone but instead people have figured out how to work the system. I go home and I feel so low. I guess its bc I really wanted to be great to my team but I feel like the group I have is horrible. They always have an issue, whether personal, or just unhappy with the job. They come in with a negative attitude and it sucks the life out of me to be positive for them and the rest of my team. The hard part is the need to treat them as though I dont hate them and still provide great management and fairness. I'm just kind of complaining but I'm in some real need of any encouragement right now. This job is not what I wanted it to be and I'm becoming really unhappy due to it."
"You seem to know yourself, what you want and where you are going. Just amazing!!","I grew up in a home where the only point of existing as a girl was to get married, be a good wife and have kids. When I failed to get married in my 20s, and now am in my almost mid 30s, I am considered a failure by my religious family. It doesnt matter that Ive moved alone, found a job to support myself, had to learn absolutely everything on my own.  My mom doesnt care and wonders why I wont just settle for a guy who will make money. That guy has never come along and I didnt have the option of being homeless and jobless.Yesterday I finally researched in detail about ux (user interaction) design. I finally learned about the process and how I could start this path.For the first time this year I have felt hopeful. Its been such a bad year, so many horrible things happened. I had a legit near death experience a few months ago and had to deal with legal research and consequences of that.For the first time I feel hopeful even though Im alone and have no one to be happy for me."
"Climbing to the mountain top isn't ever easy, but once you're at the top, the view is beautiful. So keep climbing, knowing that the mountain top is around the corner. Don't rush it and try to let go of any anxiety you have about getting there quicker. Try to bask in the trial of it, knowing that the harder it is, the bigger the reward. Find peace in that these things are just for now and it's really only but a blink of any eye in the rest of your lifetime.","Hi Reddit! I could use some encouragement. My living situation is really weird right now. Three days/nights a week, I live in a small city for my master's program. During that time,  I live in a house with this random older woman (she's nice, but still random) and a roommate. It's comfortable enough, but def not my home and I always feel like a stranger/guest. The other three nights a week, I live with my fiance four hours north in an apartment that we don't love in a town we both hate (it's super rural, we miss our families & friends in another state, etc). So, half the week I'm at school in a weird living situation, and the other half I'm with my fiance in a weird living situation. So, my car is kind of my home. I keep all my stuff in my car all the time (so yes, it's a mess). This arrangement will only last until Christmas break, so I have like 10 more weeks to go like this. This whole thing was my decision and done by my own hand, so I really have no right to complain, but it is still confusing and difficult. To make it all even more weird, one of my professors also hired me to house/dog sit a few nights a week, so I'll also be staying in a third house sometimes coming up. Anyone else ever lived out of their car, kinda? Please share any encouraging thoughts or ideas with me to get through this odd phase of my life!!! "

"You be just as proud as you can about this! It sounds like it was victory for you! Congratulations on being able to take this first big step forward, and I am so proud of you for not only stepping up to this new, scary challenge but knocking it out of the park.",I am a struggling makeup student for 3 years and I finally got my first paid job for working on set for a short film. I was extremely anxious over it and stayed in a hotel for 4 days just to get some work experience which I never thought I could do this early on in my course. I did it and smashed it and I wasnt tagged in the promo post by the director who is also a student btw when he tagged everyone else. My parents werent too fussed either. I thought this was gonna be this massive achievement but now I feel like maybe I shouldnt feel so proud of myself as I am.
There is nothing wrong with a B.

I've never worked in a bank before so I don't know how strict they are about these types of mistakes. But it seems to me that it was purely an honest mistake and a learning opportunity. I hope they can see that and give you a second chance. Don't beat yourself up about a mistake though. It's not a life and death mistake and it's not worth stressing too much over. I really hope it works out for the best as it seems like you care about this job - that's not always the case with employees and hopefully your company recognizes that. ,"It turns out, the only thing  I'm allowed to say is that the funds are not available (in the account). So I had just revealed private information.I called a coworker over to help me figure out what was going on and when the call ended he gave me this 'I can't believe you did that/You were not supposed to do that' face and said that I shouldn't have revealed the account balance and that all I was supposed to do was verify whether or not funds were available. I felt so stupid, because honestly this is how we verify other funds for people who aren't customers. I should have known that it would be the same.

"First off, asking for help is a huge first step. Good for you! Secondly,  I'm sorry all this change hit you at once.  Change is hard for us humans. But you're doing it...the tough work of keeping it together in these trying times.Action will make you feel better, but ironically your brain may be telling you the opposite.  Try to stay in action.  Help others, if you can. Even writing positive notes and leaving them around the neighborhood is helpful.  Call mental health hotlines, there are plenty, and talk to a professional. You've said exercise is important to you.  Go for walks, if you can do so safely. Do some at home, YouTube workouts. Drink some water. Clean the house. A neat living space makes a real difference in mood. Most importantly, be kind to yourself.

All of this timing is so bad and every day the few things ive been able to do to take care of myself have been eating healthy, going a run, and doing a tiny bit of homework, as well as spending tons of time on the advice subreddit trying to help others.  I know i'll get through this, i know ill go back to being able to make myself happy without a need to feel complete from others. But Atm i am struggling with self care and my own self worth.   Please say something nice to me?"
"Almost everyone has been there at some point! Stick in there bud, theres nothing you can do about the sour people in the world. More importantly, dont change who you are for those people. Keep your head held high and know that youre better and more mature than that. Self-image is a struggle for most people from time to time and is completely normal. But dont let people get to you and dont compare yourself to others - these are two important but tough lesson. Kill them with kindness and confidence no matter how you feel. If you want to feel better about yourself, for yourself, you can always try new things like eating healthier, working out, trying new clothes, etc. You do you, unapologetically!","Hey guys. So Ive been struggling a lot with self-esteem when it comes to my looks. Ive had the same haircut since like 4th grade  (10th grade now) and get teased about it. About a month ago I tried something new, only to be made fun of for that. I ended up reverting back to my old hairstyle. Today i got a haircut (just shortened my hair, didnt change the style) and, once again I was made fun of, even by an adult coworker. I have acne pretty bad, and regardless of what I try its just inexorable. My ears stick out super far, and the young kids I work with say I look like an elf. I have major bags under my eyes due to a type of insomnia, and my face is unsymmetrical when I examine it.At this point its just a struggle to deal with all these things. Im fairly popular but still face social anxiety, especially when talking to girls, due to my low opinion of my looks. I could really use some encouragement. Any and all is welcome. Thanks guys :)"

I was looking at myself in the mirror, and I could feel my brain pulsating and *moving*, like it was rewiring so rapidly that it was causing a physical sensation. Ive never felt anything like it.I suddenly felt enormous guilt. It was as if the universe was angry with me. I had opened Pandoras Box. I was this underaccomplished loser that barely achieved anything noteworthy in my life, always felt like a disappointment to my family, and here I had just stumbled across something that could change the world. I didnt deserve this, I hadnt worked for it at all, it was literally something I thought of while I was laying in bed after hitting the snooze button.That was the exact moment my psychotic break triggered. I became convinced that none of this was real. All an elaborate farce. My personal version of hell. I screamed and smashed my head against the mirror repeatedly. I had smashed through the medicine cabinet and wall behind it."

So, I'm in my last year of college after failing out a few years prior due to a major depressive spiral, and not realizing I needed some major changes in my life. I've made it this far, but yet I am feeling very panicked. I'm struggling with my finance course (I am not a math/numbers guy in the least) and my microeconomics course. I have lowered my expectations from doing well in the class to passing the class. This isn't what I want. I want to succeed and do well, but halfway through I fall down and stumble my way through the rest of the course. I've already put myself a semester behind schedule because of this. I'm so close but I am dealing with a lot of pressure as well. I can't afford (literally) to push anything back another semester as I am maxing out on federal student aid after this year. I have two courses to take over the summer that will finish my degree (assuming this and the next semester go well enough) and I have no idea how I am going to pay for them, as one is a costly short-term study abroad that I am pretty much pigeon-holed into taking. I feel like a failure for not finishing my degree the first time, and for getting myself into this whole mess by wasting money like crazy that last year at my previous institution among other things. I'm mad at myself for letting myself fall down like this. I'm mad at myself for not learning the first time that I need to be more proactive on things. Gah.Sorry for the feeling vomit. If you made it through all that, congrats, and here's a towel to wipe off the feeling vomit. "

Anyway, I just need some tips on how to get my dad's words out of my head, or at least a link to a funny meme to cheer me up or something.

My parents are separated so theyre always fighting over who should help me when money gets tight. Ive ran through about 3 jobs at my new location and cant seem to find the best job to keep me steady. I turn 20 literally on Friday and the fact that Im 20 with no stable income and barely getting by is killing my motivation and the way I want to handle things in life. I just feel like I have nothing going for me anymore. The only thing I can say Im motivated about is starting up my own kicking camp to teach high school football kickers the most important techniques and tips for training and in game situations. Besides that I cant find something to hold on to that would keep my head high and keep my motivation running. I just feel lost and empty and I wish I could ask for help but I know Ive already asked too many times. What are some tips you would have to keep a persons motivation running?"
"We bought ""Only Natural Pet"" probiotic blend fyi","Hey all. My girlfriend and I just adopted a rescue dog (German Sheppard) and brought her home yesterday. The thing is, she is a REALLY tough case and really put us through our paces last night and this morning. We could really just use a little cheerleading to boost us up and keep us going for a minute. We've both had tough dogs before, but it's been a stressful time in general so it is extra tough at the moment. Thanks! &lt;3"
"HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!  And ALSO, good job on keeping a close eye on your account, knowing your bank balance, and paying your bills on time.  Having to keep to a tight budget sucks, but you're doing great.  I hope you could plan to have your party some other time; even though it won't be exactly on your birthday, there's no reason not to celebrate anyway.","So I knew I had enough....but when I saw I only had $8. My heart sank....because....I'm the type of person who never buys anything for myself because I have always been broke. I have been scammed out of money through my parents. I have had precious items sold from under my nose by family.....I once had a $100 electoric guitar and $50 amp bought for christmas one year....I didn't even have that for a year. I went to school one day came back and it was gone. My older brother walks in and said he had to sell my guitar and amp to help pay for his rent which was a joke cause he was doing drugs at the time. I was taught by my foster parents that everything had a price for it even if it was a gift so I get really anxious when someone gives me a gift cause I think, ""Oh shit what's the price for taking this?"" I just... I felt really bad that even though I was able to get like $14 of drinks and two cool bracelets too. I felt bad cause I was telling my two friends I was planning on buy pizza for them and cake even though it was for a late birthday party for me but I felt like such a idiot cause I wanted to proved something for them too and I .... I blabbed about it.......I know it's dumb for getting upset about something like this.....but I was just wanting to give myself a party and just not have other people worry about costs of food cause i want to prove for others and just have fun and relax.....but I got so upset at myself cause I wasn't able to get the stuff I just cancelled everything.....And now I'm just getting drunk on my own to just forget how fucking stupid I can be at times.....I'm...... I'm sorry I couldn't get what I planned to have."
"It will be ok! Explain to the teacher that you are willing to do extra work to bring up your grade, or see if they will let you re-test. if you get stressed during tests schools can set you up in a room by yourself to take them. ","Hi all. Today I had ny first genetics test. I felt confident when I was studying the material, however the test didn't go so well. I started at the back of the test because those questions are typically longer and harder. I didnt have enough time to answer everything. I left two questions blank which automatically brings my grade down to an 86, and I'm certain I will be docked points for other things. I didnt even have time to look over my answers to make sure they were correct. Feeling kind of low. "

I got to the interview, and somehow bombed it (it was a video interview). I am honestly at my wits end at this point. I even fasted for one whole week and prayed. I made sure I SUPER researched the company, potential questions, EVERYTHING. I don't know anymore...I am not sure what is happening. But i need a yes soon. One year is whatever but 4 years (and some change) is...I don't know, I am losing all my confidence. Please say something. I don't know. maybe i am just venting on reddit ."

"Hey Carbon, you sound really intelligent from how you write! You've got a plan towards your dreams, it just wasn't what you originally thought it was going to be. Life is like that sometimes. It takes a really strong person to stand up from failure and continue to persevere to their dreams. I believe in you and your capability to one day become a doctor. Nursing could also give you a unique perspective on medicine, which is something that will set you apart from other applicants when you decide to apply. You've got this! I'm cheering for you, and I am inspired by your ability to self reflect and move forward with a plan that you believe is right for you, regardless of the opinions of those who don't believe in you.","Why nursing?:As I mentioned before my passion and my driven mood is in the medical field. One of the most remunerating parts of a role in nursing is the capacity to associate with our patients on such a close level. While we frequently meet under exceptionally troublesome conditionsbeing available as individuals face genuine wellbeing difficulties or wounds, seeing the snapshot of birth or the finish of lifewe become more acquainted with our patients rapidly and have the chance to assume a significant function in their lives. I turned into an attendant so I could affect the lives of others and have a role that felt important.Why not dental, pharmacy, or any other career?I have looked into each of these careers and more but my whole academic career was based around being a medical school student. Ranging from classes to volunteer hours. Often times when looking at other careers, I found most needed stellar GPAs and volunteer hours in the respective field. Which as Im a senior who graduating in the fall, is just not possible to  do to jump start my possibility to meet at least what the average student does. I even looked at special masters programs and even non-master programs to help boost my gpa to somewhat offset myself but most masters programs I looked into required a 3.0, for me to take specialized test such as the MCAT, GRE, DAT, or more."
Stop thinking negative thoughts about yourself. Replace the thoughts with good thoughts. Even if they feel fake at first. Pretend its a game. Write a list if you need to. Read it to yourself every day. Listen to subliminal messages at night that build you up.,"Serious question....  Asking for a ""friend"".... "
"Hey friend. I know its hard. Just know that were proud that you are doing well. For tips, all I can say is study as much as you can and do the best you can. Personally, I believe in you. A lot of us do. Dont feel like youre a burden to your family either. Think of it as them helping you succeed because they care for you. I hope this helps. I wish you the best of luck in your studies. And if these attacks are getting worse, please see a therapist.","Im finishing up my first semester of my freshman year of college, Im majoring in premed. Right now its looking like Ill get somewhere between a 2.8-3.0 gpa at the end of the term, since I learned today that one of my classes (that I currently have an A in) only counts as a pass/fail class, and is not calculated into account for my gpa. That spiraled into a full blown panic attack, two hours of tears, and questioning whether or not I should shift my career focus. On top of that, Im out of state and need a 3.25 gpa by the end of the spring to maintain my scholarship. Both of my parents are now working full time to keep me here and I feel like Im letting them down. I dont know what to do. Im going to work my butt off on my finals but the fear of failure on top of my testing anxiety is freaking me out.

"Sometimes there are no words to ask for help.  We've all been there, it's not stupid. =)Hang in there, my friend.  If the words come to you later, we're here to talk it over.  You're not alone in this.",I don't know what to say and this is really stupid. I'm just asking for some good thoughts this way. I'm so tired and discouraged and don't want to do this anymore. Please think of me.
I understand how you feel. As Im actually about to leave for an event to try to do that same thing. Connect on some level with people. Mostly because my therapist told me thats what i needed to do. But every fiber of my being screams make up a reason not to go! But Ill go and Maybe enjoy it. Knowing that someone else has the same struggles helps. Take care of yourself!,"I have a tough time connecting with my dad (mom died 18 months ago).  I am on the fence about whether my husband and I should really be together.  Sometimes I would rather be by myself and my thoughts than other people.  Sometimes my internal monologue is just really negative.  Sometimes it just seems like too much to call a friend.  Problem is, I have a son and I know I need to open up and show him how a person can connect.  I don't really know where I need to go but I wish the guys from Queer eye could come and just fix my life in a week.  I guess I just have to do that for myself.  I think I need to force myself to go out and talk to other people and do things to bring me in to connection with the world.  I just feel like hiding under a blanket for the rest of my life.  I of course can't do that.  Wish I could be different as I constantly don't like myself.  Not really sure what I'm asking."
"The first step is always the hardest and you took it! That's amazing! Everyone gets those little doubts that hold us back but you're beating them and that's something to be proud of. Chase that happiness, music is a beautiful expression of the best things in this world and so long as it is something that comes with joy it will always shine. I checked out your video, please don't doubt yourself! Everyone starts somewhere and you've taken that leap, you've already gotten the hard work started.

Best of luck, you can do it!","And when it came to singing with anyone, I always considered myself a back-up singer. I'm just someone with a soft voice, and I harmonise, I told myself that's the way it is. I should never sing as a lone voice, or sing a melody.

As far as friends, and the depression, I cant tell you I've discovered something that has brought me out of depression, and I have had thoughts of suicide. The thing was simply a REAL relationship with Jesus. I don't know your stance on Christianity, but I am not talking about rules, just a relationship, just love. Also, just being real, rather you believe in a God or not, at some churches you can find some really friendly people!

I attend college but honestly have no real clue what I wanna do with my life, I have a very strong interest in mathematics though and would love to help advance technology. Last semester I got straight As but sacrificed my social life for it, and now even when I try to make friends at school, nobody shares similar interests to myself or cares to pay any attention to me. Everyone else just cares about stuff I don't care about like drugs or video games, I want to get out and explore new things. I love action sports but I have lost interest recently due to both my depression and lack of friends to bike and skate with. I really need a girl in my life to help me, I have a more sensitive side that I'm showing now that needs to be vented. Ive only kissed or had a relationship with one girl ever and she cheated on me after two weeks. I am such a sincere and open-minded person and girls always turn me down, or claim to really like me a friend ( I'm fine with that) and later avoid me. Finally, I met an adorable girl recently who I connect with so well, but she only wanted to be friends, which I agreed to, yet now she always has a lame excuse to ignore me.

"And dont worry about America. From what I have observed of America, it looks like you and your people will be able to get through this.

"So Im not an artist but heres my idea:Since you excel at commissions try to treat your own work like a commission. Sounds stupid at first but generally a commission has all of the details and ideas fleshed out for you and you just do the drawing, while your personal projects im assuming you have a general idea for but are working on the fine details more as you go along rather than before. Take a look into your commissions and see the type of things people say in requests that make the job easy on you.","I'm an artist with original story ideas, many of them over 10 years old, but I've never been able to sit down and finish them. And that fact tends to extend to so many projects. I'm capable of doing so much art for others at huge speeds (commissions) and in that sense I'm super productive (multiple illustrations a day, even if rhey are small). I can easily sit down in the morning and producing art until before bed, but when it comes to my own stuff, it's almost impossible to just sit down and finish projects, be it an artbook, a plot, a comic, a game... I always end falling back into drawing commissions or illustrations, which I can finish with ease.It seems so many gamedevs or comic artists finished projects by the time they were my age or just a bit younger. Shouldn't I have projects behind me and not just illustrations by now? I'm getting closer to finishing stuff, but while I suffer of a quarter life crisis I fear I will just get old too fast to get it all out. It's a scary thought... I sure hope my capacity to produce become exponential with time or rejuvenation therapies become mainstream or something, because the stress is not going to help me make a better product either"
"Well, I am not an expert in making people feel better. Hell, I am scheduling a visit to a psychologist soon. However I will tell You my ways of dealing with it. First thing I do in situations like that is trying to look at it at the current perspective - the current state of lamp is broken. I can only do something to change this state now but what was in the past stays in the past.","Looks like the depression and disappointment hit me post midnight, as Im currently up at 5 am typing this. You know when only *one* small thing goes wrong then suddenly youre all up in a rut about every life decision youve made? Well, Im feeling really shitty about the fact that technically I allowed two things of my own possession to get slightly damaged, all in one night. Due to being lazy in bed, I asked my dad to shake my lava lamp to let the floating hardened liquid to sink towards the bottom. He shook it too hard, causing the whole thing to fall apart and for the lightbulb to lose one of its connector pieces. He said hed go to the hardware store soon to replace the lightbulb, but Im in slight doubt if the lamp will work after that, feeling that its my fault, in technical aspects. This is going to also sound ridiculous, but my new phone (no case, no screen protector) somehow slid off the surface I placed it on while doing something this late at night, causing it to hit the hard floor screen first, getting itself some small scratches on its corners in the process. I know the scratches arent that bad, but my obsessive compulsive disorder really tests my tolerance when it comes to the smallest things. And it was a new phone that Ive only had for a couple of weeks, for crying out loud! Ive just been self deprecating for the past two hours, so far.In sum from all of this, how do I effectively diminish the thought of I could have done this to prevent this or that so I can learn from these small situations that have been bothering me for the past couple of hours? I guess I somehow have a compass as to how I can solve this, but hearing something from somebody else would really encourage me."

Fear. Im afraid of losing those I care about. Im afraid that Im not good enough.

"I think going back to school is a great idea if thats truly something you want! I was never a morning person in college, but trained myself to be!

I've located a technical college that:\- is less than half an hour from my house (\*super convenient\*)\- has a six-month certificate program (\*not so short that it feels incomplete, not so long that I get frustrated\*)\- offers job placement assistance after graduation (\*SCORE!\*)\- classes start at 7:45 AM (\*record scratch sound effect...\*)Oh dear.

"Tough, wow!You're in a tough spot and the consequences are hitting you really hard. You have to hit that bottom of making bad choices and facing the consequences. Sounds like you're definitely there.Consider applying for jobs close by. Take public transit or walk. Ride a bicycle. Consider utilizing online apps/resources and market yourself and offer to cut yards, take dogs on walks or perfoem non-complex landscaping. Hustle to earn money and that will help you to make it a (bit) easier. A lot of this is mind exercise too. Be confident in yourself, really think about choices/consequences as you go and start to prove to yourself (and others) that you are capable and responsible.

She's nice, funny, quiet, shy, cute, and from the little bit we've interacted she seems like an interesting person. We haven't interacted much outside of passing conversation because I'm also a pretty quiet and shy person, so the few times I've had the chance I've never been able to think of a way to interact with her without it seeming very forced or making it awkward for one or both of us. The crush level has gone up recently because she got me a cheesecake platter for my birthday. Not an unusual thing as she's always bringing in cookies for everyone but it made my day all the same. I've got the chance to return the favor, but it's not under quite the best of circumstances; She's got a surgery scheduled for this week, and while it's not major she's said she's still really scared (Can't blame her). Add in her having a bout of the flu and she's been in a pretty bad place the last few weeks.I decided to get her something to cheer her up and settled on making her cannoli (I saw from a FB post of hers that she liked it) and spent the last few days carefully finding out her favorite flavors and any food allergies she may have without directly asking her."

From your story this seems like the perfect gift and the extra effort would only indicate that you actually care about her. Don't hold back man be proud of it. ,"I've got my recipes and all my ingredients, but my brain (Which is very good at self-sabotage) has come up with an outcome I'm having trouble dealing with.

I could just buy the cannoli and cut all this out, but tracking down the recipes and making them has and will help with the anxiety about giving them to her. I also feel the situation calls for the extra effort. I'll most likely say this when I give them to her, but that doesn't make the thought go away or the whole thing any less daunting.So have at me r/encouragement.

I'm cheering for you, and I am inspired by your ability to self reflect and move forward with a plan that you believe is right for you, regardless of the opinions of those who don't believe in you.","So what do you mean you paused medical school?:I never want to let go of my dreams of becoming a doctor. So my logically thinking self has set that I would take a break become a nurse and then reevaluate my situation and always go back at a later time if I dont find nursing to be what I truly like. For the sounds of nursing on paper it checks every box. Ive shadowed a lot of nurses and genuinely love the interactions and meaning behind being a nurse and the role they play. So maybe after a couple years of becoming a nurse, work on getting my CCRN and pursing my interest in CRNA or just seeing where I go. So what are your thoughts right now?:In my mind everything is plays out perfectly but in reality, I first have to get accepted to nursing school. However, nursing school is competitive and being from a disadvantage background there are days that i feel like Im not doing anything right."
"Definitely! You just have to find or create those things that live up to the ""dream"" or ""happiness"" you are seeking.Life is rough at times, some moreso than for others. Painful things happen - both physically and mentally.But, you only have one. You don't want to die with regrets. Live it to the fullest and find those dreams along the way.For me today? I'm going to have a bowl of some lucky charms frosted flakes. What a freaking combo!... The dreams don't have to be big. Even little ones count.",Has anything lived up to your hopes and expectations ?It seems like the dream is better Is the best part of life fictional?
"It hangs over you like a dark cloud when you leave something unfinished. What you're doing takes a lot of courage, hard work, a financial burden, dedication, and above all it demands that you have faith in yourself. You've got this. Don't let someone else convince you that because it's not guaranteed you'll land a job it's not a good idea to go back to school. You waking up tomorrow isn't guaranteed. You'll be proud of yourself. That's what matters. And I mean the letters are cool too.","I've been away from school for a few years dealing with personal things and now I'm finally deciding to go back. I have a lot of doubts and insecurities about how much money I'm spending on a degree that might not actually do me any good, especially since I took a few years off from getting it. But this is not a decision I'm making lightly, and it's one I've spent many many nights thinking about. It seems every time I bring up these fears with people they advise me to keep waiting until I'm sure, or to think about getting a different degree. They love me and are trying to support me, but I think they miss the point... and I've only felt worse since I began making these fears known. To clarify I'm going back for a science BA in geology, a passion of mine. Any sort of words of positivity or encouragement would go a long way for me. I try my best to be an optimist, but lately I feel very pessimistic about this very big deal in my life that I was originally looking so forward to. "
Cancel your subscription to Netflix. Hope for the best. But take control of your destiny. Make work! It's a great opportunity to have freedom. But freedom comes with the good and the bad and it belongs to the brave. God bless :),"My husband and I just moved to a new state, bolstered originally by the assurance my previous employer would keep me very busy with freelance work. About three weeks in, the hours dropped to two or three a week instead of the original 15-20. It's simply not enough money to help run our household and now we're back to living paycheck-to-paycheck.I'm working with a recruiter to find a full time job in an office, but I'm sad to leave my remote work office because I love it at home. I'm feeling like a slacker that I don't want to go out and find a job because I want to work at home, but every minute that ticks by without more work makes me feel like an even bigger slacker.My husband is encouraging and supportive, he's not worried and just wants me to be happy but every day drains my soul, waiting for work to come in that doesn't. I don't know what kind of encouragement I need, all I know is that I just want to crawl into bed with the dog and watch Netflix most days."
"Understand that surgery is traumatic to the body, and you are having a very human experience right now. You may need more time to acknowledge this in your recovery. It sounds like you might have expectations that everything should be as it was when returning to your craft. But things has shifted, and that is what you are noticing. The resistance to this change will keep you farther from your craft because the resistance takes the form of an energy that requires more of your attention than that of the inner peace you experienced from practicing your craft. The resistant energy is asking you for its attention right now. This can be hard to accept, because you just want to practice you craft like before... You have the memories of  performing at a certain level not so long ago. You know you can do it.","I feel like I was on the cusp of finally getting my dream job (in the arts), but I had to take a long break due to a surgery that had complications. Now Ive been back at it for 2 months, and I feel like everything Ive worked for over many many years has gone out the window. Im doubting everything, I feel like I dont know what Im doing and I ruined my chances of succeeding. Things shouldnt be this bad after 2 months back at it, and Im embarrassing myself around my colleagues.  Ive never seriously considered giving up on this career path until now. I feel like Ive been trying so hard and for so long that this stupid surgery setting me back like this is too much to handle. Some words of wisdom or encouragement would really help me right now. Im struggling to see how this can possibly be made right."
"Hey, thats great youre thinking about stuff such as retirement.  Of course theres only so much you can control, as our bodies are destined to wither and fade over time, but you can be proactive in controlling what you can!  Do you eat (like eating to live not living to eat and being hydrated) and exercise well? Honestly, thats one of the best things you can do.","I'm actually relatively young (26) , and I'm an artist. But for months I've been more and more fearful of the concept of retirement due to ageing, and ageing in general, I guess. The idea that unless rejuvenation sciencie gets as far as expected, my body will start giving in against my will and I will be forced to stop doing what I like.Is it possible to be efficiently active and old? Or do I reach a point in which I peak and then, no matter my discipline, I am condemned to go lower and lower, never doing as good again? Isn't there something I CAN do? Can it be a matter of attitude?  I already am super productive to counter, but it's not helping that much with the fear.Maybe this is the reason why I'm a big futurist and transhumanist, but I'd like to believe I'm not just delusionally grasping a burning nail and have reasons... But I digress."
Happy birthday!!! Hope you feel better soon!!!!,Hello everyone!This is my first post on Reddit. I haven't been feeling too well lately I was throwing up and had a really low blood pressure due to anxiety ups and downs and I injured a part of my back on my birthday today and could hardly walk because of all the pain. Just felt kind of lonely since I have also had a hard time emotionally lately due to a lot of stress and don't really have friends or family like people that knew at all where I am and it's just raining the whole time lol. Still glad I have my bf with me :)Thanks everyone

I did make it through! Good to be back in the world of the living! ,"Hello,I am a college student who recently got the flu.

"Keep yourself busy first off; that will help keep your mind active and not wandering to depressive/negative thoughts.I know the feeling though; I've had fleeting periods of depression myself thinking the exact same thing--that my life is wasting away. If I allow that thought to remain valid, my actions will only support it; it's in overcoming the thought that productivity leads to goal completion and a better feeling of success.Look for jobs all over; I heard on the news that many industries are lacking workers because unemployment is so low. This means that there are more jobs than there are workers so you are bound to find one.If you can't find a job offline, explore options online.","I just made a big post in r/depression about how my life is wasting away.

You have value too, I promise. Lastly, I'd definitely encourage you to continue to pursue someplace to go for your mental health.

I have a waitressing job 4 days a week. The money has fallen to $60/shift in tips plus a paltry $4/hr. It's a daytime waitressing position, as I have the tendency to become extremely unproductive during the day and drink to excess when I'm off at 10pm or later. It's happened countless times.Beyond that, I find it nearly impossible to live with a stranger. The last two roommates I have had that I didn't really know have ended badly. This is why I moved in with my brother and his family. I babysit with little to no advance notice a few times a week (for free of course). I try to stay in my room and not make a mess. I try to get up with my niece and let my brother and sister sleep in when I am able. I haven't even been there 6 months."
Might be time to switch careers or go back to school or something...I know you got this,"Thursday I got let go from my job. In the last three years since moving to Portland I have lost every job Ive had. The career Ive been working in I am burnt out in. I know that if I get a job in this same career, its just going to happen again. I have a wife and two kids and I just kinda need some random strangers to tell me things will be okay long enough for me to actually believe it."
"Amen amen amen!!! Im going through the exact same thing. Its super discouraging feeling so out of place. We will get better, do better, and feel better. Time heals. Positive energy to you, my friend!","...and I swear to God I have no idea what Im doing. I dont know if Im doing well, or if Im crap. I feel like an idiot and I hate it. Im a damn perfectionist and I hate it.Today even went theoretically very well and I still feel like I havent achieved a tenth of whats possible.I just need to hear that this is normal and that it will pass. That at some point Ill learn and I wont be constantly depending on others."
So i moved cities and started to work on me. There is nothing wrong with me i am worth the greatness of love. Seven years later i meet a great man who loves me for my good and bad. He lets me rant over death of penmanship and how its a lost art. Its a bore fest but he knows sad it makes me that kids today dont know cursive. You know yourself and how much you can handle. If its a bad look for you then change it. You got this. Stay strong.,"I guess Ill explain my situation. For about 3 months now Ive been talking to this girl. After our first date she said she didnt feel anything for me and so I tried to move on. After about a week of not talking to her she texted me asking how my day was. Since that day she started talking to me non stop every day. She then started to get kind of flirty and lead me on. When I talked to her about it, she said she was confused because she didnt feel anything originally and now she thinks things are changing. I was excited and so I just kept doing what I was doing and things were going great. Things went bad on Friday the 27th. The subject of our relationship status got brought up again and she said she was conflicted and part of her wants to just remain friends and part of her wants something more. I asked her if we could talk about it in person but we had to end up FaceTiming. It turns out all that flirting and leading on was her intentionally doing that to see if she was interested. What I took as affection turned out to be experimentation and at this point she was trying to avoid telling me the truth. Ive been rejected before but this one was different."
"Having other people tell You it's fine and give You their insight on the matter really helps, though try not to overuse it or at least not to vent to the same person all the time, otherwise You will become toxic towards that person as they will have to deal not only with their problems but with Yours too. Approaching them sometimes is fine but drowning them in Your problems or only talking to them to vent is not good. So talk with multiple people instead of just one, internet is a great tool for that! Third thing I do is distract myself.","Looks like the depression and disappointment hit me post midnight, as Im currently up at 5 am typing this. You know when only *one* small thing goes wrong then suddenly youre all up in a rut about every life decision youve made? Well, Im feeling really shitty about the fact that technically I allowed two things of my own possession to get slightly damaged, all in one night. Due to being lazy in bed, I asked my dad to shake my lava lamp to let the floating hardened liquid to sink towards the bottom. He shook it too hard, causing the whole thing to fall apart and for the lightbulb to lose one of its connector pieces. He said hed go to the hardware store soon to replace the lightbulb, but Im in slight doubt if the lamp will work after that, feeling that its my fault, in technical aspects. This is going to also sound ridiculous, but my new phone (no case, no screen protector) somehow slid off the surface I placed it on while doing something this late at night, causing it to hit the hard floor screen first, getting itself some small scratches on its corners in the process. I know the scratches arent that bad, but my obsessive compulsive disorder really tests my tolerance when it comes to the smallest things. And it was a new phone that Ive only had for a couple of weeks, for crying out loud! Ive just been self deprecating for the past two hours, so far.In sum from all of this, how do I effectively diminish the thought of I could have done this to prevent this or that so I can learn from these small situations that have been bothering me for the past couple of hours? I guess I somehow have a compass as to how I can solve this, but hearing something from somebody else would really encourage me."

All of this timing is so bad and every day the few things ive been able to do to take care of myself have been eating healthy, going a run, and doing a tiny bit of homework, as well as spending tons of time on the advice subreddit trying to help others.  I know i'll get through this, i know ill go back to being able to make myself happy without a need to feel complete from others. But Atm i am struggling with self care and my own self worth.   Please say something nice to me?"
"Friend, Im sure he appreciates the support you give him. As for encouraging yourself, I would recommend a therapist as that therapist probably has the best advice for you.As for encouragement, perhaps listen to how your boyfriend encourages you. If he doesnt, it may be best to let him know you could use some encouragement. Other than that, Ive been told a gratitude journal helps with things like this. I hope youre able to find a way to be positive and I hope everything goes well for you.","So I need help, I've been through quite a lot lately. Going to NC with my controlling family, and from that I was depressed for months and my wonderful bf was there for me and encouraging. Ive been struggling with positivity and it's like my brain just doesn't know how to change a sentence to not be demeaning. Is there a good book on encouraging because I want to have his back and he shouldn't have to give everything to lift me up, I just wish I was better at lifting him up. A small example that we had a fight over. He got a gym membership and I'm allowed to be his guest, it was great until he got tired of going and I was encouraging enough to get him there. He wishes I just told him when we would go because I can't get in without him. He was mad at me because he said that he got us to the gym and I didn't do anything to keep us there. But he also hates this gym and works alot so it's not like I want to force him, I want him to be on board. This is mostly rambling but anything that anyone can do would be most grateful. I love him so much and he deserves better support."
"You should talk to your doctor to see if there is a better alternative to your current medication. I would also start training my body as soon as possible to wake up and get ready when you would need to for school even if you have nothing you actually need to do.

But it's not enough to live on, so I'm planning to get some electrician training. There's always a market for that, they're unionized, and I love working with my hands. So far, so good. I've located a technical college that:\- is less than half an hour from my house (\*super convenient\*)\- has a six-month certificate program (\*not so short that it feels incomplete, not so long that I get frustrated\*)\- offers job placement assistance after graduation (\*SCORE!\*)\- classes start at 7:45 AM (\*record scratch sound effect...\*)Oh dear. There's a reason I work the evening shift. I know this is a petty thing to get hung up on in the face of such an otherwise-perfect opportunity, but it's been a VERY long time since I've been required to get up early on a regular basis. And now I'm on medication with a side effect of insomnia. My current situation is unsustainable, and these early classes will allow me to stick with my usual evening shift; but I have a long history of being easily discouraged and can already feel myself backpedaling. I need someone to talk me out of talking myself out of this."

I finished my original degree 17 years ago and have worked in IT since then but the past year had really made me fall out of \~\~love\~\~ like with that.  I've wanted a masters for a long time with the idea that eventually I'd pursue a new career as a public policy analyst so I've gone back to undergraduate courses in economics and math with the idea if I do well I'll pursue a masters in economics but if not maybe public policy or political science or just go back to work.  Of note I'm married with a 6 moth old daughter.Well...I showed up to my first calculus test (I originally passed it with an 89.6 in 2002 but am retaking it to prepare for calculus II) and the teacher told us we couldn't use our calculators and to put them away. We all panic.  I didn't even finish the test.  Well, I just got back my grade and it's a 37/100 and I'm panicking thinking this was all a mistake quitting my career to go back to school just to try and find a career I was actually passionate about.  I'm enjoying learning but failing that bad has me in panic mode.  I already struggle with depression and I'm hoping to benefit from talking with someone about it.

Then I get an email from my boss. So around November 14th, he tells me I need to ""pause"" work until December 5th due to some cash flow issues that he needs to straighten out. I'm not happy with this but I can't do anything about it because I work remotely from home as a contract employee. But today's email tells me that all of my accounts are being deactivated to ""save money"" and that he hopes the team can get up and functional again in January and he hopes I'll be part of the team then.So I'm essentially now unemployed for all of December which means Christmas is going to suck even more than usual, and I'm probably going to spend the next couple of weeks struggling with the heavier bouts of depression and anxiety again.I've been applying for jobs both remote and local for two months now and I haven't gotten anything, no bites at all.

I try to get him to participate but all he said to me was ""I do it when I feel like it"" and continues to act childish, so I give up and wait for people to return to the common area.When we're on our way home, he conveniently starts talking to me telling me how he wants to catch the baby and I ignore him. He doesn't like the fact that I didn't respond to his request so he starts berating me saying, ""that's why all black women are single mothers, because all of you are dysfuctional, you're dysfunctional."""
"Work through this first and so many things can fall into place afterwards. Dont want a counselor? Assuming you are of a Christian religious belief, try your (or any) pastor. If of another faith, find the equivalent to a pastor. Again, assuming a Christian faith, a fellow Christian should not judge you - Thats Gods realm, not theirs. And Im sure most religions / faiths would align with this. Be respectful of yourself and others but own who you are.","I am going on a journey of self discovery and Im really scared to open up about something personal that I need to ask. Im afraid that I wont be accepted or that people will treat me differently or like Im not normal if I do open up about this which is why Im deciding to ask a bunch of internet strangers in another sub that is more suited to my issue (sorry guys but this just isnt the right place for THAT encouragement) I really just need to be encouraged that it is ok to open up and dive into this self exploration. Im truly terrified of what others are going to say or do because of my upbringing (very religious, still am) and the nature of the subject at hand :/ I even went to far as to make an alternate account with a new email so my friends and family that use reddit cant find me on here and find out about this before Im good and ready to tell them. Please just encourage me to begin this self discovery and take the steps I need to help myself figure out who I am truly. Sorry for the long read, but thank you in advance! (Ps, I think Im more insecure because I tried to do this once before with the wrong group of people and they totally brushed me off in order to bring the spotlight to their own self and their issues instead and Im scared of that happening again)"
"Moving away (especially when you've had setbacks before) can be CRAZY scary, but it's really a testament to you that you're taking this massive, brave step. So first of all, please give yourself a massive pat on the back and take some time to be proud of yourself! It's easy for a stranger on the internet to say ""everything will be grand, it'll all be smooth sailing"" etc, but unfortunately life seldom works that way. So my advice to you would be to make sure you create a safe environment for yourself where you can ensure your mental and physical health stay good. Do not compromise on these, as at the end of the day jobs, friends, money come and go, but your body and mind are forever.",I moved away from home in February and had to move back because of my mental and physical health. I just got a really good job that impacts my whole career and Im moving away again and if anyone could give me some kind words Id really appreciate it. Feel free to ask questions too

"Even if it's basic tricks it's still impressive! It's about practicing and having fun, if you like the tricks and you have fun performing them then that will resonate with people.

I'm normally not like this, there are \*very\* few things I feel self-conscious about but for some reason getting into this art as an adult, I feel a weird anxiousness about it.I did a few tricks in high school, studied as an actor in college (didn't go anywhere but I liked the experience) and generally the most animated in a group of friends, I think I'm pretty natural as an entertainer. I do not understand why I suddenly care so much about what people are gonna think to see a 26 year old doing beginner tricks. Especially since my friends are such good supporters, they wouldn't make fun of me even if I super flubbed a trick.I understand confidence is a big factor in magic, in any performance art so I'd love to hear some inspiring words to help me shake off this apprehension.Thank you all ahead of time!"
"I failed mine the first time too. It is more about practice like I thought I'll fail my second time for sure too. Like the lady told me to do a U-turn and I BLANKED OUT like I fucking blanked out. But like I didn't have time to sit there to re-organize my thoughts ofc. So I just went with my instincts and got the procedures correctly. So I suggest you to just practice more and be attentive. Don't panic too much. If u blanked out and got the procedures wrong then, you didn't practice enough. Tbh, it also depends on who was testing you. Mine was pretty nice and even corrected my mistakes.","Hey, 18 F here. I have pretty bad anxiety and i finally got the courage to schedule my driver's test a few weeks ago. I studied my heart out, took 11 pages of notes on the driver's manual, and i thought i was ready. But I missed a stop sign and that's an automatic failure. I never even saw the damn thing because there was a tree branch in the way, and ended up missing a second one because I sort of went into a panicked state and shut down. When I parked and the lady told me a failed, i started bawling and I ended up crying all the way home and for a few hours after that. My dad (bless his heart) ended up having to call me out of work because when the time came around I was still crying and refused to get out of bed. Having a license is a really big thing for me because it's the next step in becoming completely independent and the bridge toward being able to finally quit my shitty job, move out, and get away from my kind of abusive mom."
This is inspiring.,"At 13, i was desperate enough to give up my BODY for some company. And it wasn't until i was 15, still alone and in misery, having attempted suicide 7 times in my life, that I realized something.The only thing worth living for was the enjoyment i gave up. I gave up my life for talent. And now, as i watch people tell me that they have no talent, and that nobody could love them, it hurts. I would give up so much to be bad at something again! To be able to scream loudly in the car or use all my paint just to draw something dumb. I would give up my life for some childish enjoyment.Even now, i have a hard time finding ways to feel alive, even if I've given up things like talent,, and the fear of being alone still haunts me every time i open my mouth to sing or pick up a pen to draw,, but i want everyone to remember something,,,Don't give up your happiness for approval.

"I can relate to the self-loathing, too. Somehow with practice, I got to a nice place of accepting myself. It takes practice. I changed some things about my physical body and changed my mind instead on other things. Physical and mental self-care is something I still struggle with, but when I muster up the patience to commit to it in ""manageable chunks"", it's left me feeling much, much better about myself.

I was extremely anxious over it and stayed in a hotel for 4 days just to get some work experience which I never thought I could do this early on in my course. I did it and smashed it and I wasnt tagged in the promo post by the director who is also a student btw when he tagged everyone else. My parents werent too fussed either. I thought this was gonna be this massive achievement but now I feel like maybe I shouldnt feel so proud of myself as I am.

"It cuts you down when people sneer, smirk, joke, bully, make fun of, etc... at you and it is hurtful. Yes, completely! But, the thing is, honestly, those people are hurting just as much (if not more) and are just better at hiding it. More often than not, they are more damaged than you are. I certainly dont say this to provide the impression that you should feel better than them because they are actually worse off, but know that they are no better than you because they are skinny, pretty, etc.. They, too, struggle. Everyone fights a battle that you know nothing about.Its not until you are much older that you realize how kind you need to treat one another. No one wins or improves by cutting each other down.Its hard, but you have to find self-worth and confidence in yourself.","I'm 19, I weigh 235 lb I used to be 250 at the beginning of the year, but it's really hard to keep exercising.

Part of it's probably because I'm paranoid but I feel like they were saying look at the fat girl trying to be like us Jesus Christ she doesn't f****** belong here. And so I ran home.

"I hear parenthood refocuses a person's priorities and perspective on life.  The realization that a new human being -- their well-being, education, role-models, their entire future! -- depends on you *should* be a life-changing experience.  Unfortunately, many parents seem unable to put their children first.  Self-worship is a lonely religion.  Children and society at large suffer because of it. You're doing the right thing to focus on being a good mother to your son.  IMO, you deserve a partner who is dedicated to being a good dad, not just a father.

I created space between the both of us, so he would not feel as if I was in his space or threatening him. Instead, he flew into a rage and started to berate me saying that I was keeping his son away from him and I was like every other bitch that tries to hold fathers back from their kids"" I tell him I'm not keeping the baby away from you- I just want to go home. All of a sudden, he is choking me very aggressively. I defended myself by slapping, kicking and scratching him to get off me. He puts me in full nelson and slams me on the couch.

"And if you fail from time to time, like humans are known to do, that's okay, just keep going and trying again until it gets easier and you can move on to whatever is next.

You have value too, I promise. Lastly, I'd definitely encourage you to continue to pursue someplace to go for your mental health.

I wouldnt worry about your writing skills too much. The point of an MA is to teach you how to write well last time I checked. I just wish you the best of luck in your studies and I hope it goes well. Congratulations on your bio degree,"I recently finished a BSc in biology (the thought-process was to start off in biology, and segway into vet-school after a couple of years). I ended up changing my mind about vet-school pretty early into my bachelor's, and that's when I started thinking about changing my major to something artsy (I had always had a passion for writing). What stopped me from doing that was the unintentional (at least, I think it was) pressure my family and relatives put on me; out of all 6 grandchildren, I was the only one who was doing significantly well in university; my two older cousins both dropped out of their undergrad after about 5 weeks, because they couldn't cope with the level of difficulty (I'm not in any way throwing shade, people can choose to do whatever they want in their lives and I honestly couldn't give less of a flying fig). Anyway, I was continuously being flooded with words of encouragement from my relatives, and they very quickly stopped calling me by my name, and instead started calling me ""the biologist"". And, although the encouragement made me feel good about myself, I couldn't help but start to feel trapped in my academic path: ""I'm the only one of the grandchildren who's academically inclined, the others have shown absolutely no interest in pursuing a university degree...Hell, they've nicknamed me 'the biologist', I can't stop now, I'll surely let everybody down"". So, I finished my biology degree (nothing fancy, no co-op, no job waiting for me when I graduated, nothing), but now I've been thinking about getting a Master's in literature, or fine arts, or English (in about 3 years). I'm still scared that I would be making a stupid mistake by choosing a MA instead of a MSc, and that I would regret it, especially since I don't even believe my writing is that good."
"i hope everything's settled down for a bit. the past 4 days sound incredibly overwhelmingly horrible. some weeks (hopefully few and far inbetween) will be like that. and i hope that doesn't discourage you, but those weeks, all you can do is just stay afloat and alive. you won't feel like you're drowning forever. i don't have much else to say. i just hope you have someone to talk to.","These past 4 days have been awful and I don't know what to do anymore. It all started on Thursday ( some context I'm 16) I got a call during school lunchtime that my best friend Jay(18) had been arrested for assault, he had beat his sister's  abusive boyfriend half to death so I'll probably never see him again but then an hour later I hear from my good friend John that my friend Mike(15) will be moving out of state because he got his girlfriend pregnant. Oh and not being able to see 2 of my friends wasn't enough I got pulled into the counselors office and told that I will be repeating earth science and that I will be taking a course over the summer. And on top of that my mom kicks me out of the house for 4 hours and I don't have a car so I get to bike in a rainstorm and when I'm finally allowed back in she tells me that I need to fuck off and stop being bad at school. It feels like my life is over and that I'm falling under and that I'm trapped if you have anything to say I'm all ears"

Thank you so much everyone!! We are going get dinner in about 20 minutes (:,"Im 7 months postpartum and having some trouble getting over PPD. Lots of crying lately and being overly sensitive to little things that wouldnt typically bother me. I guess just feeling pretty insecure personally. Also not feeling like myself- I used to do a lot alone like go to the mall, the movies, out to eat. I used to be very tidy and organized. I used to read and crochet. I do almost nothing that I did before I became a mom and now its like everything is about my son and if its not then I feel like a bad mom. Anyways, I just reached out to a girlfriend of mine and asked if she wouldnt mind going out for dinner so I could start trying to get out of the house. Would love some encouragement that this is a good step in the right direction because my heart is actually beating fast from embarrassment."

"Hi! I'm in my first semester right now at community college, working for my compact major too!

Just understand that your determination and perseverance in trying to understand a material and your strong desire to learn about subjects are more important to me than being knowledgeable enough to pass quizzes and tests. Thats not to say quizzes and tests arent important and you should stop studying for them; there are just other ways to measure intelligence than a grade on a quiz.Good luck with your studies and I hope things go well for you. Your effort in trying to understand the material in your classes and your organizational skills is admirable and will give you a serious advantage in the rest of your studies. Best wishes and sorry if this message is a bit long.,"in school, i can say im a try-hard, im the one with lots of notes. who actually tries to study and listen in class. i try to projects way earlier than it's due. especially now in online class, i do hws, that are supposed to be passed next week, on the day it was given. that's just me.but the thing is i sometimes feel like that's the only thing im good that. being organized and being able to get my requirements done. anything other than that im dumb unless i study really hard. earlier, i had a quiz and i failed. and it's okay, but I felt discouraged becausr i try so hard yet im not smart enought to get good grades. it makes studying, for me, harder.i dont know and honestly this isn't even that deep compared to other problems here :))) i just needed to rant"
Hugs. Facing our parents mortalities means facing our own. Im so sorry.,"Just looking for some encouraging words. My father is dying -we think based on his deteriorating heath for many years and age, and that he never really reaches out to us. He has been reaching out to each of my siblings to get together. It has fallen to me to arrange this. Im the youngest of 6, thought we are all in our late 30s and older. None of us is particularly close with him, so I didnt think this would be hard, but damn if it isnt really hard.   "
"Hey, I don't have any of the background to give you any advice whatsoever but I will say this... You need to hang in there and keep moving forward, through all of the things that are bothering you and are in your way.  Only that... and time will change your situation.Please know that I'm thinking and praying for you.  I know you probably have trouble trusting people but maybe you can find some kind of counseling there to help you.  There are some wonderful people and subs on Reddit that could help too.You've been through so so much already.  You can get through this for sure!","Hes in Argentina now, living his dreams. Im happy for him but also sad because he couldnt gather the courage to tell me he couldnt talk to me anymore. I had to figure it out myself. And Im here in College. Once again, didnt think Id make it this far. Its great because my parents arent here to abuse me and I dont have to regularly interact with the people who sexually abused me like I did back home but aside from that and he extra freedoms I have, life is tough. I dont have any friends here. And I mean I try SO hard. Im that girl who is he social butterfly and who talks to everyone. Its just that Ill form relationships with people here but in the end they always prefer hanging out with other people. I feel very excluded and lonely. Any encouragement would be appreciated. Life has been a lot harder than this and Im still fighting, but its all a lot to handle. And his isnt even everything. Any act of kindness would be greatly appreciated thank you."
"100% a great step. Mothering is such a bucket emptying activity - you give everything of yourself to your offspring and they cannot wait so that you can care for your own needs at the start.

I turn 20 literally on Friday and the fact that Im 20 with no stable income and barely getting by is killing my motivation and the way I want to handle things in life. I just feel like I have nothing going for me anymore. The only thing I can say Im motivated about is starting up my own kicking camp to teach high school football kickers the most important techniques and tips for training and in game situations. Besides that I cant find something to hold on to that would keep my head high and keep my motivation running. I just feel lost and empty and I wish I could ask for help but I know Ive already asked too many times. What are some tips you would have to keep a persons motivation running?"
"Climbing to the mountain top isn't ever easy, but once you're at the top, the view is beautiful. So keep climbing, knowing that the mountain top is around the corner.

My living situation is really weird right now. Three days/nights a week, I live in a small city for my master's program. During that time,  I live in a house with this random older woman (she's nice, but still random) and a roommate. It's comfortable enough, but def not my home and I always feel like a stranger/guest. The other three nights a week, I live with my fiance four hours north in an apartment that we don't love in a town we both hate (it's super rural, we miss our families &amp; friends in another state, etc). So, half the week I'm at school in a weird living situation, and the other half I'm with my fiance in a weird living situation. So, my car is kind of my home. I keep all my stuff in my car all the time (so yes, it's a mess). This arrangement will only last until Christmas break, so I have like 10 more weeks to go like this. This whole thing was my decision and done by my own hand, so I really have no right to complain, but it is still confusing and difficult. To make it all even more weird, one of my professors also hired me to house/dog sit a few nights a week, so I'll also be staying in a third house sometimes coming up. Anyone else ever lived out of their car, kinda? Please share any encouraging thoughts or ideas with me to get through this odd phase of my life!!! "

I learned that sharing my ideas, interests and hobbies will always been seen as weird. It's made me struggle with talking to new people and even made me fearful for thinking about making friends. I have accepted the fact that I am seen as weird and that has made me socially anxious to make friends. I can't even look at a person in the eyes without thinking I look weird. I've grew up going through certain events that made me shut myself off from the world and be ashamed to share my interests and not know who I really am. I'm going to be 29 this week....And I feel like I have learned about things in life so late and that that makes me so under developed.

"Friend, this is a lot to deal with. And Im sorry you have to deal with it. I hope you find a job soon, and I hope it treats you well.What Ive learned from my experience is that when it comes to jobs, if the work environment is good, then youll love the job. Its no so much the field as it is the environment. So my advice is to choose a job with a good environment for you. Then youll learn to like the job. And as a fellow person with Autism, I can say you can make it. It is difficult to overcome and Im sorry that not everyones understanding towards you. Just rest assured knowing that the symptoms can be overcome. And you can live the life you wanted.Hang in there, I believe in you.

So, it was very hard work but I did catch up, although unfortunately because my Autism (it's not my parents fault, they honestly tried and so did I) I wasn't able to do the work required of me to graduate. There were subjects I just couldn't grasp and understand at the time. So, I wasn't able to graduate high school. My Mom talked with me about my future (we were living in U.S.A in southern California at this time, we moved there when I was 16 years old) and she didn't blame me for not graduating. She knew I tried really hard and it wasn't my fault or hers or anyone else's that I didn't graduate. So, anyways her and I talked and she thought it would be a good idea for me to live on disability rather then get a job, so I applied.

While he was in his cast he was itching to get riding again and when he finally got the chance to he was on his bike within an hour of being given the ok. A few hours later he went down hard again. He escaped with a bruise, nothing broken. Now he won't ride and if he does, he'll spend five minutes getting his gear on, get on and ride for 30 seconds and then put it away. He told me in secret he is scared, he doesn't want to get hurt. We aren't pushing him but he is seriously down.

"Hey Carbon, you sound really intelligent from how you write! You've got a plan towards your dreams, it just wasn't what you originally thought it was going to be. Life is like that sometimes. It takes a really strong person to stand up from failure and continue to persevere to their dreams. I believe in you and your capability to one day become a doctor. Nursing could also give you a unique perspective on medicine, which is something that will set you apart from other applicants when you decide to apply. You've got this!

I registered this semester to take all of them. They dont start till October 14th but most programs let you still apply to them so long as the classes are completed by the time the program starts. So I still have time. UAB has a competitive program but the deadline for the spring has passed and I wouldnt start till the Fall of 2021. Its still in option but I wanted to start as fast as possible. So looking into programs that start in spring 2021, most of them were ADN programs but I knew if I wanted to advance my career in nursing, I would need at least the minimum of a BSN. Often times when I decided I would do an ADN at a smaller university I would fill out the applications only to find out I would need more classes because a lot of my classes wouldnt transfer from UAB which helped in my GPA aspect but meaning more time before I could actually sit in a nursing program. That being said with a miracle of luck, I found this joint program with a community college that actually partners with UAB to allow you to get your ADN and BSN at the same time."

","I came back to the apartment a short time later and told him, ""I am not keeping your son away from you, but I think it's best that I go home with my because we are not getting a long at the moment."" I created space between the both of us, so he would not feel as if I was in his space or threatening him. Instead, he flew into a rage and started to berate me saying that I was keeping his son away from him and I was like every other bitch that tries to hold fathers back from their kids"" I tell him I'm not keeping the baby away from you- I just want to go home. All of a sudden, he is choking me very aggressively. I defended myself by slapping, kicking and scratching him to get off me. He puts me in full nelson and slams me on the couch. I fall on the floor and the altercation is still occurring and I'm still defending myself by kicking and hitting him in the leg. He punches me the jaw and backs up."
Best of luck to you. You can do this!,"I'm super nervous and I'm not going to lie, I have no confidence I'm going to get this job with the Misdemeanor Bad Check Charge from almost 7 years ago with jail time.If I did get it even with min wage it would be a life changer. It's hard to get excited when you're told no a lot but I really am hoping for the best."
"For someone who has been in the exact situation as you. You have to let her go. Sometimes you need to see where the darkness takes you. And if you can't fully get hurt, you can't fully get healed.","And she's just tried to move on so fast and get rid of everything that I helped her with in her life- like helping her eat healthy (she's a dancer), or getting organized, or anything like that. And she's turned the relationship against like me and making it seem like I'm the bad guy, even though she lied to me for years about certain things, and even cheated on me at the beginning of the school year (for like 2 hours, but still). And we're both at fault, but she just has been really mean and cold about it. And I don't want her to convince her to love me, but I just really care about her, and I'm just confused at how fast this entire thing happened. And really, I just don't want to she her hurt herself when she's living on her own with (almost literally) no guardrails or anything in her life- just kind of feeling it in the moment, and doing whatever she feels like, because I just want her to at least take care of herself and not do anything she will regret.I just need some encouragement. I don't know what else to do."
Good luck!,"She's a friend of mine, we hung out the other day at a carnival and when we rode a ferris wheel the guy letting us on called us ""lovebirds"" so we treated the day as a mock-date. She sent me a message saying ""that was the most fun date I've been on and we aren't even dating"". I want to send her a message back saying ""since we had such a good time on our fake-date, would you wanna go on a real one"" and while I think I have a good shot, I'm still a bit worried about it.

"Hey Carbon, you sound really intelligent from how you write! You've got a plan towards your dreams, it just wasn't what you originally thought it was going to be. Life is like that sometimes. It takes a really strong person to stand up from failure and continue to persevere to their dreams. I believe in you and your capability to one day become a doctor. Nursing could also give you a unique perspective on medicine, which is something that will set you apart from other applicants when you decide to apply. You've got this! I'm cheering for you, and I am inspired by your ability to self reflect and move forward with a plan that you believe is right for you, regardless of the opinions of those who don't believe in you.","It felt like every little thing I did, rubbed everyone the wrong way. No matter if I did one thing right, three four, sometimes six things would go wrong. Whether that be with school, friends, parents, or any other things. I got involved with the wrong crowd, not like drugs or anything like that but typical college things like partying and drinking. At the time it made me feel good inside and it took control of me and I let go of everything. Some night I would want to go to bed and not want to wake up or if I did wake up, I didnt want to leave my bed. So much, I didnt care about academic or what anyone said to me. This dreadful choice I made, costed me two- three semesters of failing out of classes. It was when I was put on academic recovery, I realized the consequences of what I had done and the potential effect it had on me wanting to achieve my goal of getting into a D.O school or M.D. School."
A B is still good! You are doing well especially after a transfer. Cut yourself a little slack and keep chugging along. You got this!,I just transferred from a community college to a cal state and I wanted to get all As but that B is getting to me. Im too hard on myself but yeah. Like Im bummed about it.
"You deserve better. And, know that there was nothing you could have done to have avoided this.All of this is on the company. You sound like you are going to be a very valued employee in the future. Dont let corporations make you feel that this is a reflection of you and your work. Because it simply isnt true.","It is now week 3 of my first ever internship and every day I come home feeling worse about myself and how things are going. I try to ask questions but a lot of times I feel like Im so confused I dont know where to start or my manager is not there and i dont even know who to go to for questions. When he is there and I ask questions he always seems to answer in a way that makes me feel stupid and like I should have just figured out the answer on my own. I am currently working on 3 projects and a couple side projects for my managers boss. Not sure if that is normal or not but I am feeling very  overwhelmed and anxious. Im just tired of coming back to my apartment everyday feeling like Ive accomplished nothing again, I am constantly wondering why I was hired for this position when I know so many others that would probably do better. I just want to feel like I did something right at work : ( "
"Hey, I don't have any of the background to give you any advice whatsoever but I will say this... You need to hang in there and keep moving forward, through all of the things that are bothering you and are in your way.  Only that... and time will change your situation.Please know that I'm thinking and praying for you.  I know you probably have trouble trusting people but maybe you can find some kind of counseling there to help you.  There are some wonderful people and subs on Reddit that could help too.You've been through so so much already.  You can get through this for sure!","So the title says it all. I grew up in an abusive household, but not too abusive where it was enough to call CPS. So I dont really have anywhere to go back to. Somehow, I made it through high school, but it was difficult. I was sexually abused as a child for years by kids my age and several adults, including my parents saw it happen or at least knew about it and did nothing about it. Ive also been physically abused by friends and by my parents to a mild extent. Im on the journey of healing and have been for about 3 years now but its hard. Back home was a bad place for me. Then senior year rolled around and long story short my life changed and I actually have people in my life who love and care for me. I even have a few adults that look after me for the first time ever. Until recently, I had to raise myself completely, and now I have a tad bit of help. The problem is that its difficult to get in touch with people from home because they straight up dont answer my calls as much as I wish they would. And the people that do are not the type of people Im comfortable sharing personal details with. I fell for a boy this summer for the first time and it was really difficult to navigate because of my history of abuse but he was probably one of the most amazing people Ive ever met. But then he decided to pretend like I didnt exist because it hurt too much for him to say goodbye."
Whats your region?,"i apologize if no one here plays league, but i hope someone does and gets what im talking about.so, i only started playing ranked in league these past few months. i never really played outside of normal games and just dicking around. my reason for playing ranked now is that i made friends who all play it and i enjoy playing with them, but theyre all so much better than me. so ive been striving to get better not only for others to be proud of me, but to be proud of myself. earlier this morning, i was 2 wins and 2 losses into my silver 4 promos. i lost my last game, and lost the promos. but now i want to sit down and grind back up there and make it. i dont know if i can do it, but i want to get there. from what everyone has told me, once you get out of bronze it gets easier to climb because in bronze everyone just bangs their head into a wall and its hit or miss if youve got a team of monkeys or not. i want to get there and keep climbing.....and not have to deal with a garen with the wrong keystone losing 1v1s to a kayle before you even finish your first clear as a jungler, for example..........i just need some encouragement. this is a bigger deal to me than it should be, but its something i want to do nonetheless."
"That being said, I would also advise you to take every opportunity you can (as long as they don't compromise your mental/physical health). You are giving yourself a new start, so don't be afraid of doing things you might not have before. Life can be richer for it. Be kind to yourself, be proud of yourself, and go through the next year or so with the knowledge and that you ARE capable, you ARE good/strong enough, and you CAN handle whatever life throws at you whilst you adjust. Good luck OP xx",I moved away from home in February and had to move back because of my mental and physical health. I just got a really good job that impacts my whole career and Im moving away again and if anyone could give me some kind words Id really appreciate it. Feel free to ask questions too 
"Love, it hurts! You are making hard choices for a better future! You can stay strong, and keep trying! ","An argument ensues that travels back to my apartment. During the argument he pushes me into a clothing rack because he felt I was in his way. He takes the sonogram picture of my son and throws it in my direction and hits the floor causing damage to my apartment hardwood floor. I ask for my key back and he throws my key at me and I tell him to leave. At the time I was 6 months pregnant.&amp;#x200B;Incident 4Partner and I were attending a birthing class.The class is suppose to give couples the idea of how to support each other during the laboring process. The instructor told us we can go to a birthing room, but there wouldn't be enough open rooms for everybody. We get a late start to look for a room and of course all of them are occupied.We return to the common area, and he gets an attitude and starts to pout and scroll on his phone and refuses to do the activity with me in the common area. I try to get him to participate but all he said to me was ""I do it when I feel like it"" and continues to act childish, so I give up and wait for people to return to the common area.When we're on our way home, he conveniently starts talking to me telling me how he wants to catch the baby and I ignore him. He doesn't like the fact that I didn't respond to his request so he starts berating me saying, ""that's why all black women are single mothers, because all of you are dysfuctional, you're dysfunctional."""
"If you don't want to say here then pm me, I'm in a similar situation but very slowly getting better, I hope at least. So yeah, I might have a few things I could recommend but it all depends on your particular situation. Otherwise the best I can say going by what you've written is the typical trite like: build new habits like going for walks every morning, expose yourself to busy public areas every day, stay informed, get a routine, integrate yourself into something like a club or meetup group, you know the typical shit like go to the gym or find good books you'll love. Actually the book one is a favourite of mine, when you find a particularly good book you can often draw some great motivation from it in weird ways. I feel for you though, some days I'm too lazy to even open a book.",I've been lazy for too long and I want to make a change in how I work and how I spend my time. My biggest concern is that I won't follow through with the promises I've made to myself surrounding this. Some good vibes would be much appreciated.
"And that's absolutely alright. Self care is going to feel difficult, I absolutely understand that. Everything feels bleak right now, but it won't feel that way forever. None of this is going to be forever. Give things some time to straighten out, and straighten yourself out with it. Don't Force it too much right now.","Ive been on a downward spiralMy fianc and I have moved in together at the start of 2020, which either highlighted or exposed some major dependency issues that she has. On top of that, her mental health has been beyond terrible for herwhich is likely a huge driving force for the dependencyand Ive gotten Caregivers Fatigue 3 or 4 times already. I desperately want to communicate this issue but she can already read it off of me (been together for a long time) which is making her mental health worse at times, and I think if we were to outright have that conversation it would cause her mental health to be even worse. She also gets upset that it seems like I view her as helpless and unable to function without me, and admittedly I do because shes so extremely needyI hate myself physically. Literally from my head to my toes: I cant find a good haircut and the barber that I helped out with that couldnt be consistent, then COVID hit and Im out a barber & reference point for my hair. Im in too low of a funk to consistently care about maintaining my beard which is as frustrating as daily care would be. Ive been gaining fat all of 2020 which not only do I want to lose weight but Im also a nutrition major so thats not a good look."
"So, as long as they respond without judgement, it should be fine opening up to them.As for your friend, I had a friend who was similar to what you described. My friend took many things personally as well and often acted offended when I said some things. For example, he often liked hugs and would hug me. But it became too much for me at one point. I brought this up to him, and he got angry at me. My Point is, I know what you mean when you talked about your friend.",my friend told me to stop and I did but now I feel like doing it again and I dont know what to do....I cant tell anyone about it because Im afraid they will try to help or even judge me.

"Stay strong, don't compare yourself to others, and be patient with yourself. You're the only one who understands what it's like to be you, and I know you have things to feel proud of. As long as you're doing the best you can to improve _your well being_, I know you will turn out pretty amazing.

Good luck out there!","I quit a sales job after 2 months and have been unemployed for a month now.

"I am not the best with words but I hope this short message reaches you: I have big respect and great admiration for nurses like you, more so now that you are among the frontliners, among the first to battle the invisible enemy.Politics aside, I am sad and it irks me that health workers are seemingly underappreciated by the government in my country. I also hope everyone realizes that you guys are human as well--feeling burnt out sometimes and needing rest.With this being said, I want to be able to reach out to them and to know of one here on Reddit could be my way of extending gratitude. Again, thank you for all your hardwork. Many of us appreciate you. High five!","Hi all, I'm a nurse, working in the time of Covid. All politics aside, its just a really hard time to be a nurse. Long hours, frayed tempers, everyone is on edge. I'm just fried, and I miss my coping mechanisms of pedicures, massages, and spa days. They've been replaced by activities like hiking and meditation - its fun, but it's not what I really want. I come from a big family. We must update each other every week on how we have been. Negative points if you don't make the weekly Skype. Even more negative if you dont 'bring it'and show how you are 'crushing Covid.'I'm so tired. I have about 10% gas left in my tank. I just need a smile, or a nod, or a 'sup' just to say that regardless of where we are, it's going to be okay."

He's telling me I'm trash, that's why I don't have a ring on my finger, all of my relationships in the future will result in men passing me around because I'm a grimy person. I fall for this trap and lose my shit and get into a verbal altercation with him. What made me really blow a gasket is when he tells me that he gave me another chance and I haven't changed my behavior. I hang up on him. I decided to call him later in the day and noticed my number was blocked. This isn't the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth time he's done this either. I get upset again, so I call his mother and tell her whats going on and state that I feel my son should not be going out of town with him because my partner has a habit of not answering phone calls because he's upset with me and I don't want my son out of town and I have no way of contacting any one to see how he's doing while he's away from me."
"Take the leap. Trust me. You might be lonely for a couple weeks, even months. That will pale in comparison to the next year.Im 33 and honestly, its easier to make friends as an adult. It takes way less common interests when you both live and work in the same city, those common things provide most of what you need.You are good enough and there are so many people just like you there. Just give yourself fully to the experience and you will find your way, everyone does.","I want to move to NYC next year and start my degree as an FNP, but Im scared. What if I dont make friends? Those first few months might be really lonely especially in the fall. At the same time Im 26 years old and have dreamed of living in NYC since I was 13. I never really had the college experience when I got my bachelors, I didnt make that many friends, even though Im a social person. Im worried I cant do it and that Im not good enough.

"Well, it's D-Day and I'm as ready as I'll ever be. This is the last day I'll see her before her surgery (Her usual days off are Thursday and Friday). Ended up having to buy the cannoli shells (There's more of an art to it than I thought) but other than that spot on I think. I went with three flavors; Vanilla, mocha and key lime. Here's [the goods](https://i.imgur.com/XlR1cxc.jpg).","I've got my recipes and all my ingredients, but my brain (Which is very good at self-sabotage) has come up with an outcome I'm having trouble dealing with. Putting aside the anxiety I'm feeling about just giving them to her, I'm utterly *terrified* she's going to think this is some kind of assholish passive-aggressive one-upmanship because I'm making the cannoli rather than buying it like she did with the cheesecake. I could just buy the cannoli and cut all this out, but tracking down the recipes and making them has and will help with the anxiety about giving them to her. I also feel the situation calls for the extra effort. I'll most likely say this when I give them to her, but that doesn't make the thought go away or the whole thing any less daunting.So have at me r/encouragement. Advice, encouragement, wisdom, please send word."

This is inspiring.,"And at that point,, i had spent so much time focusing on talents and being loved, that i lost my enjoyment. And once i lost my enjoyment,, there was nothing left. But people came to me,, they came to ME!! for art!! It was stunning, until i realized that that's all i was. A source of talent. They ripped those pieces I'd worked so hard for out of my hands and kicked me to the dirt. And from then on, the prices got bigger. I learned how to paint, i became the soloist of my choir, i learned to cook. Nothing was enough. Eventually, i even started offering money or items for love, and even my body."
"You survived open heart surgery. Your life is yours to live and do with what you want. This woman clearly is not in the right frame of mind to be a good partner to you. What she said was hurtful and reductive. A good partner would have been extra affectionate throughout your recovery, made sure you took enough time to get better, celebrated your successes and asked you about your follow up appointments.She parroted some hyper traditionalist nonsense that made you anxious at a time you most needed her support.You can do so much better. Your worth in a relationship is not determined by the amount of money you bring to the table. You are not a 'bad provider' for taking care of your health first and foremost. All the best to you.

(30) She lived with her parents for the entire duration. Recently her father quit his job because he couldnt take a vacation the days he wanted to.Within 3 days of hearing this story I was informed they would be moving across the state and that she would be going with them. Note at this time we had plans for marriage and had a great relationship.Today she ended our relationship. Her reasons where not her own they were the exact parrotings of her parents far right wing conservatives note that I am not white or conservative. We never let this affect anything or even talk about it. 3 months ago I had open heart surgery at 29. I now noticed since then things have gone downhill.Long story short she made me feel used worthless and broken. That I dont have my life together and cannot be a Provider. But I know these are not her words. Unfortunately nothing I say will bring her back. I just need some assurance Im not those things she said. Please.
"No, I think you're right that nobody can really tell the future... but we've faced a lot of shit so far, and humanity is still here. The black plague, the great depression. Hell, the civil rights moment with MLK. Things won't always be bad because the real power lies with all of us, and we're using that power now as a society.I think you have a right to be upset, scared, depressed, anxious, and I won't try to rationalize why you *shouldn't* feel that way.

On top of all this, I had a falling out with one of my best friends and he turned some of my other friends against me.

We were barely friends before but after I asked for her number we got really close. She said the reason she doesnt want to make our relationship anything more is because she doesnt want to destroy the relationship we have right now. I dont know how true that actually is.

"Depression is no easy thing to get over, especially when your family causes it.One of the first steps would be to talk to your mother, heart to heart. Tell her how you feel and how guilt is getting the best of you. Maybe ask her to appoint you a therapist/counsellor. You won't always get As or Bs (neither do I) but that doesn't matter. As long as you try it's okay to fail. All of my siblings are also extremely intelligent and I'm getting terrible grades. Also, look into getting an agenda. They help a ton with time management. And lastly always ALWAYS remember there are people in this world who love and care for you and if you were to die they would shrivel up.","it comes and stays for a while and stays and stays never fully goes away my depression comes from school and my family it grows more and more every day there's this boy I like a lot and he makes me happier but I hide most of my problems from him because i don't want him to worry school is tuff and I don't know how to stay focused during homework and I cant seem to get the stress off of my back.my mom bugs me about managing my time and she's right but all she does is make me feel guilty and unwanted. all i have been wanting to do now is just die die die die die die die die die die.and i keep thinking about it. I stay up late doing homework because I can't manage my time correctly and I'm getting low grades. my sister, on the other hand, is perfect and has almost all Bs and As all I have is one A and three Cs and a D in my grades. I can be very aggressive at times and I want to get better but I just don't know where to start and I need serious help with it I'm not sure what to do anymore ig. I've tried self-harm to make myself feel better and I've tried takin to God about stuff and he still gives no signs of encouragement and I just don't feel as if there's a purpose to living any more."
"When people sees you doing a magic trick, they are not going to think how long you've been doing them. They will just enjoy them! Even if you are doing beginner tricks, they will likely think you're not that great at it. Not the nicest, but fixable with experience, so don't worry about that either.Besides, it's never too late to pick a hobby. If anything, you should get into hobbies at any time you feel like. It's a new experience, it is fun, and no matter you age, it will enrich your life for as long as you feel like it. The you who is learning magic is a deeper, more interesting self than the one before, and that's pretty cool. If you ask me, 26 is a pretty good age to pick a new interest. It's a great sign of you as a person.","The performance art not the card game.I'm getting hung up on starting magic as an adult. I'm normally not like this, there are \*very\* few things I feel self-conscious about but for some reason getting into this art as an adult, I feel a weird anxiousness about it.I did a few tricks in high school, studied as an actor in college (didn't go anywhere but I liked the experience) and generally the most animated in a group of friends, I think I'm pretty natural as an entertainer. I do not understand why I suddenly care so much about what people are gonna think to see a 26 year old doing beginner tricks. Especially since my friends are such good supporters, they wouldn't make fun of me even if I super flubbed a trick.I understand confidence is a big factor in magic, in any performance art so I'd love to hear some inspiring words to help me shake off this apprehension.Thank you all ahead of time!"

"Awesome!  Good to celebrate the successes. =DAs an aside, FWIW, my wife (who's a dietician) says that regular meals are important -- the tendency to skip meals is actually counterproductive, even with restricted calories.

Just stopping by to share a **hug**,"I feel so weak. Im fighting back tears as I write this. My panic disorder has been so bad that its hard for me to even read a page.

Its so stupid because I know I could do it, but when the time comes Im just a mess and I cant even get through a sentence. No, I cant even get through the title of the page. It is so frustrating that I know I could do something, but when it comes down to it, my brain just stops me. I didnt reschedule the exam this time because how many times am I going to postpone?

I desperately want to communicate this issue but she can already read it off of me (been together for a long time) which is making her mental health worse at times, and I think if we were to outright have that conversation it would cause her mental health to be even worse.

He's now living in Vancouver and has been waiting for an available therapist/counselor/psychologist to help him since February (very likely that he's been too apathetic to actively seek professional help or to do follow up check work for seeing how the waiting list is going from time to time). He's broke, and his physical health isn't good. He also wears hearing aids.Last year in October he experienced something really awful. The torture was ""finished"" in November. He then had to go back to Canada to look for some professional help. Until that time he told me he had a PTSD happened in his childhood. I finally realized why sometimes he acted like this and that, and why he's had suicidal ideation.Side story: He's had a marriage and got divorced. He met me five years after the divorce.I've anxiety disorder, depression, OCDs (cough, clear throat and spit), choking anxiety and BMI is below 15.

Ive found what I need and it $15k shipped from China. Other supplier is in Germany but they want 39,000 for same equipment to be shipped. I cant afford German stuff. But I can afford the Chinese version. Now it all looks very comparable online. My thing is do I take the gamble and buy the Chinese machine? I can afford it if it actually turns up and works as promised. But I cant afford to be ripped off and it not turn up or it breaks the first time I use it. Should I take my chances or keep the money in the bank? Many thanksThe procrastinator"

At the time, my car did not have AC and I had my son in the backseat taking him to daycare. I call my partner to inform him that I needed his help because my car was disabled. He asked me to drop a pin at my location and I did but it gave the incorrect address, so I gave him the actual address of where I was. Instead of coming to get me, he started to rant about not wanting to be on the road searching for me. I get irritated and curse at him and from then on he argued me to death about he is doing me a favor and that I shouldn't be talking to people in a certain way when I need something. He continued to refuse to come and get me and instructed me to find someone else to pick me up. When I did, he got upset that I even asked him and proceeded to argue with me for the rest of the day. During the arguments he stated that he wish he never met me and had a baby with me and stated that he wished his son was dead."

I fall for this trap and lose my shit and get into a verbal altercation with him. What made me really blow a gasket is when he tells me that he gave me another chance and I haven't changed my behavior. I hang up on him. I decided to call him later in the day and noticed my number was blocked. This isn't the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth time he's done this either. I get upset again, so I call his mother and tell her whats going on and state that I feel my son should not be going out of town with him because my partner has a habit of not answering phone calls because he's upset with me and I don't want my son out of town and I have no way of contacting any one to see how he's doing while he's away from me."
"I grew up being made to feel like I am weird too. As I grew older, however, I started to feel like being weird was actually a big selling point when it came to making friends because I was able to look for others who are also weird exactly like me. I joined clubs, I started talking to people on forums, I went to local meet ups. And in that way, I also started thinking of myself differently as well because I didnt think those same friends were weird in a bad way, just in a good way. Its a day to day process but you need support in it. I suggest to take at least 1 thing youre interested in and find others like you.","I was always criticized by my foster dad growing up. I learned that sharing my ideas, interests and hobbies will always been seen as weird. It's made me struggle with talking to new people and even made me fearful for thinking about making friends. I have accepted the fact that I am seen as weird and that has made me socially anxious to make friends. I can't even look at a person in the eyes without thinking I look weird. I've grew up going through certain events that made me shut myself off from the world and be ashamed to share my interests and not know who I really am. I'm going to be 29 this week....And I feel like I have learned about things in life so late and that that makes me so under developed. I know though that I will get over it and that I will learn to accept myself and find out how I am but trying to break a pattern you have been dealing with for 27 years is the hardest thing I am going through."

Putting aside the anxiety I'm feeling about just giving them to her, I'm utterly *terrified* she's going to think this is some kind of assholish passive-aggressive one-upmanship because I'm making the cannoli rather than buying it like she did with the cheesecake. I could just buy the cannoli and cut all this out, but tracking down the recipes and making them has and will help with the anxiety about giving them to her. I also feel the situation calls for the extra effort. I'll most likely say this when I give them to her, but that doesn't make the thought go away or the whole thing any less daunting.So have at me r/encouragement.

And now I'm on medication with a side effect of insomnia. My current situation is unsustainable, and these early classes will allow me to stick with my usual evening shift; but I have a long history of being easily discouraged and can already feel myself backpedaling.

"Looking at something and going ""I bet I can do that"" and then starting and telling yourself ""I can do this"" even when it's starting to look impossible is the start of making anything.

Or do I reach a point in which I peak and then, no matter my discipline, I am condemned to go lower and lower, never doing as good again? Isn't there something I CAN do? Can it be a matter of attitude?  I already am super productive to counter, but it's not helping that much with the fear.Maybe this is the reason why I'm a big futurist and transhumanist, but I'd like to believe I'm not just delusionally grasping a burning nail and have reasons... But I digress."
"I hear parenthood refocuses a person's priorities and perspective on life.  The realization that a new human being -- their well-being, education, role-models, their entire future! -- depends on you *should* be a life-changing experience.  Unfortunately, many parents seem unable to put their children first.  Self-worship is a lonely religion.  Children and society at large suffer because of it. You're doing the right thing to focus on being a good mother to your son.  IMO, you deserve a partner who is dedicated to being a good dad, not just a father.  My heart hurts to see your suffering.Keep fighting these battles.  It's totally worth it.  Your son will be a better person because of your love and dedication.  Be well! &lt;3","He starts to berate me again and follow me throughout the house and outside. When we were outside his tune changed and tried to make it seem as if I was being crazy for no reason. I entered the house as long as he was away from me. As soon as I entered the house, he started verbally attacking me. I start to defend myself and continue to let him know that he was out of line. Did I say what I needed to nicely? I didn't. What he was dishing to me, I gave it back to him. He wanted me to stop talking and when I refused to not be heard after he insulted me, he started choking me several times in front of his mother, sister, 8 year old nephew, and my 7 month old infant son."
"I think you have the right idea, focusing on the things you are grateful for, but I think we still have to go through the pain. I seems so recently you went through a huge painful change in your life. It will take time to process it. I find that practicing gratitude is helpful, challenging at times, but helpful.","Hey everyone,I am feeling really overwhelmed, and I wasn't sure where else to turn. My long-term boyfriend left me a few days ago completely unexpectedly, the day before Thanksgiving. We share a house, a dog and two cats. I wouldn't have committed to all of those things if I didn't think he was in it for the long haul. We just renewed our least last month.I have finals for grad school this weekend and next. It's a really hard program that I'm struggling with right now. I need to get an A on one of my finals or I will get kicked out (the program requires above an 85 in all classes and I did really poorly on the midterm).I haven't had time to study. I am so stressed. I can't afford the house on my own, so I have been scrambling for an apartment. I think I found one that I can move to next Monday. I am taking my dog and one of our cats. I feel horrible for them. Do you think they know and are sad?I started a new job (with my same company, but a lot more responsibilities) two weeks ago. I just started a new medication (Zoloft) last week before the breakup happened. There is so much happening and I don't know what emotions are caused by the breakup...or the medicine...or school or the job.I know it will get better...but how can I be ok enough now to focus on school and work? I feel so sad and scared and I'm just really struggling, but I don't want to give up now. I'm sorry that I'm complaining so much. I know I am very fortunate in many ways. I wish I could just focus on that and let go of all of the pain I am feeling.Thank you."
"What's your purpose? What do you really want to achieve? Focus on that, visualize your future. You'll achieve it.","2019 is just 2 week away and I got goals and changes I want to accomplished but lately I have been unmotivated to do so. Anxiety, Watching the  news, School, and some other things. Can someone give some encouragement, I really need it  "
"I'm so sorry things are tough right now. I wish I could give you a big hug. I hope things turn around soon for you. Something that helps me when things are tough is to find one thing (big or small) that I enjoy, and do that. For me right now, it's baking. But maybe you like coloring, or reading, or talking to your family on Skype. Maybe finding something you find joy in and have access to might lift your spirits just a bit. I hope this helps.","Ive been having toenail issues for about a year now, which tops it off for the head to toe partIm unemployed right now and couldnt get unemployment, so thats really rough. Im really thankful that money isnt as big of an issue as it would be for most people, but I find myself sitting in my car in a random parking lot just to get out of the house. I legit lost all of my friends in 2019 with not even the slightest explanation. Ghosted by my college friends when I had a family medical emergency and had to withdraw from school, and my best friend blocked me on everything in December. The only explanation I can think of for getting blocked is that she was hoping this guy (who she said had major insecurity issues) would ask her out, and my assumption is that he made her block me.Student loans are beating me down because I dont know if its financially worth it to shoot for my dream. What good is it if I have to work a job in addition to my career just to pay off my loans?Im just having a rough time, and its getting to meEdit: I also find myself misdirecting my anger because Im so upset with my life. Thats actually what led me here"
"Hey, they chose YOU for a reason. It's gonna go great and you will kill it. Go get'em tiger!",I'm filming my first commercial for the red Cross today and I'm really nervous. I just need some encouragement.
Stay strong! I guarantee hes gonna regret all that when your gone. Just focus on your plan to move out,"Once again, my dad called me ""worthless,"" ""bitch,"" and ""asshole."" He's never used the word ""asshole"" on me before, so that's a new one. But anyway, I'm getting kind of sick and tired of him telling me this stuff. He always does it, and I'm starting to lose count of how many times he's verbally hurt me like this. You don't know how many times he's told me I won't have a future. After all, I'm out of the house in 4 years. He keeps reminding me of that like he doesn't want me anymore. I'm l just a Freshman, and I don't know what to do in life! It probably sounds ridiculous, I know. Literally, the only thing that is keeping me together at this point is the internet. People encourage others and make people laugh, even though you don't know them. Under all the craziness of school drama and life, I can still find some good online.   Anyway, I just need some tips on how to get my dad's words out of my head, or at least a link to a funny meme to cheer me up or something. I just need to stop overthinking all the stuff he yells at me for. I'm not good at explaining stuff, so can you just throw some comments at me? It seems like I'm just asking for attention, and now that I think of it, I probably am. I don't get any in real life, so let's just see if some random people online care! :)  why did i write this"
All the best. Turn on the charm and you will succeed! ,"Yeah, of course I'm nervous. But I hope I can finally do it. And that's the important thing. Right? Is it gonna go well? Only time will tell. But hopefully with a bit of positivity I can work up the courage at the right moment. I'm gonna try to look at my phone a little before so hopefully what you guys say I see right before and don't back out, which unfortunately I've done before. Hope this works!"
"Hello internet friend. I just wanted to remind you that you are worthy of respect, love and affection just for being you. Sounds like this woman has no idea what she wants but her wishy-washiness isnt respectful of you. I get it, Im not down on her. She has her reasons. However, you dont deserve anything less than a hearty fuck yeah I want to be with you, whether it lasts or doesnt. Let this be a lesson to not allow someone to flirt without being honest about their feelings. You can always set a boundary of what you will and wont accept. Like if you want to be together cool, if not stop flirting, we are just friends. If it ruins a friendship then it ruins a friendship but often people will respect you more when you set a boundary. You got this!!!!","She was leading me on for a month and a half and I thought I was really getting somewhere. The fact that she tried to feel that way for me and couldnt made everything worse. I know this may sound irrational but I cant help feel that there is something wrong with me and that Im screwed up and thats why this happened to me. Every time I put myself out there I get hurt and this one was a huge blow to the gut. On top of all this, I had a falling out with one of my best friends and he turned some of my other friends against me. I just cant help but feel like everything bad that happens in my life is a direct result of my actions. I had no reason to think that the girl I was talking to would have liked me in the first place. We were barely friends before but after I asked for her number we got really close. She said the reason she doesnt want to make our relationship anything more is because she doesnt want to destroy the relationship we have right now. I dont know how true that actually is. I want to be friends with her but I dont know if she honestly values our friendship or if that is just a load of crap to make me feel better. I feel like Im a failure and I feel like I hurt everyone I'm involved with. If youve read all of this I appreciate it and any advice is appreciated"
You are alot stronger than you give yourself credit for.,"I have struggled with Anxiety / depression since I was a teen and since the virus and being forced to quarantine I have lost most of my coping habits ( Gym, University, going to the beach, spending time with friends, seeing my therapist )   On top of that I have cut out of my life a close friend who was abusive, an Ex who came back for ill intentions, My half brother who was never there for me as kid, and i got rejected by a girl I've been crushing on for years.  All of this timing is so bad and every day the few things ive been able to do to take care of myself have been eating healthy, going a run, and doing a tiny bit of homework, as well as spending tons of time on the advice subreddit trying to help others.  I know i'll get through this, i know ill go back to being able to make myself happy without a need to feel complete from others. But Atm i am struggling with self care and my own self worth.   Please say something nice to me?"
So I knew I had enough....but when I saw I only had $8. My heart sank....because....I'm the type of person who never buys anything for myself because I have always been broke. I have been scammed out of money through my parents.,"So...Today I was planning on giving myself a pizza birthday with anyone who wanted to join on my campus. I only have two friends. I got a check for $100 yesterday that I cashed and I have been looking forward to this all week. Even after my birthday that happened this past Wednesday. I had some bills to pay like hulu and neflix which I didn't mind. But i made sure that I was saving enough to I could buy the stuff. I got on the bus. Got some drinks for myself and I got two bracelets from hot topic too but what I didn't realize was that most of my billing stuff happened today. So I went from $60 to $8 cause I didn't know my netflix bill and hulu bill happened today. So after I bought drinks and two cool bracelets for myself, I didn't have enough money to buy my pizzas. I was at target and I had put two digornio's stuffed cheese pizzas in my cart and I was trying to check my bank finances cause I always get paranoid that money is going to disappear. But I had $40 after I bought my bracelets."
"Well I did not post so that I could have a discussion, And you're right there are a lot of religions out there and they're all different, sounds like you're judging religion because of what you have seen. only you don't look at the good you just look at the bad. There are plenty of stories and plenty of illustrations that I have seen where having a relationship with Christ has changed people's lives for the good. I dont have religion, I have a relationship with christ, and yes their is a difference.I dont realy care that you dont belive in christ, you will one day when you and realize you let your ego and  Scientific brain get in the way of truth.","Hello, im not sure if i will continue to share my encouraging thought because people have been having problems because i use my faith to try to help people i was asked to only post everyother day because apperently im offending people, i dont understand why this offends anyone, if you dont want to read it then dont. But if you like these words of encouragement please respond!!! Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his Lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.
John 15:15 KJV
Dogs love is unconditional, always there for you, always glad to see you, ready to forgive you, love going places with you, will protect you from danger, and on and on. We would be fortunate to have a human friend who is faithful as a canine friend. Actually, we do have such a friend and such more than a four legged friend. That friend is Jesus and He understands everything we go through in life. Jesus can sympathize with our weaknesses. Human friends may disappoint us, but Jesus never will. He is a friend that ""sticks closer than a brother "" (Proverbs 18:24). Have a blessed weekend.  :)"
