"I dreamed of being a lawyer or having my own business and owning a corporation. I dreamed of so many things. Now I'm applying to work in fast food and janitorial jobs. Not what I dreamed of or anywhere near it and I'm not getting those jobs either, they keep asking for experience and a high school diploma. Even the fast food joints are doing that, which I think is stupid. What experience does someone need in order to ask the question ""do you want fries with that?"" Anyways, please give me some encouragement for my future. Something to give me hope that I can still achieve my dreams of being independent and having a fulfilling career.","I dreamed of being a lawyer or having my own business and owning a corporation.

Hello everyone!This is my first post on Reddit. I haven't been feeling too well lately I was throwing up and had a really low blood pressure due to anxiety ups and downs and I injured a part of my back on my birthday today and could hardly walk because of all the pain. Just felt kind of lonely since I have also had a hard time emotionally lately due to a lot of stress and don't really have friends or family like people that knew at all where I am and it's just raining the whole time lol. Still glad I have my bf with me :)Thanks everyone ,Hello everyone!This is my first post on Reddit.

"I've taken on a 3-year university course that is said to be really tough, but it's something I'm truly interested in. The thing about this university is that there is no project work, no presentation or participation points to help my grade- EVERYTHING is based on the results of a year-end exam. Last year, I failed ALL my modules and had to resit them, which makes me one year behind. This year, I managed to clear two of my toughest modules, but I failed the other two, which means that I now will take 5 years to graduate.My parents and friends are telling me not to beat myself up over it, but I can't help but feel so, so disappointed that I did not pass everything. I had such expectations for myself too.I guess I really feel insecure about graduating a lot later than everyone else I know. I feel really depressed that I can't do well in something that I like.","I've taken on a 3-year university course that is said to be really tough, but it's something I'm truly interested in.

"So I go into survival mode and wind back upstairs. During this time from Wednesday to Sunday, I am uncomfortable and nervous. I am under the impression that I''m allowed to leave by myself but not with my son. He finally agrees that the hurricane is no longer a threat and that I could go home. I did allow him to see my son, and try to co-parent like he wished but after picking up my son on Tuesday morning and experiencing how my partner was still being aggressive with me, I finally realized how my emotional and physical safety was at risk.I called the police and reported the domestic dispute and he was eventually arrested and forced to do anger management.&amp;#x200B;After everything had happened, I decided to reconnect with him and try again. I knew this was a bad idea, but I wanted a family and I wanted my son to grow up with family. BIG MISTAKE.

"My friend who is a lovely human being just finished paying the last payment on her $50k student debt and is now debt free a day before her 31st birthday! My friend is an amazing person - she is an artist and works to help poor and disadvantaged people get a hold of their life. Me and her closest friends are so proud of her, but due to Covid, we are not able to throw a huge party to celebrate her achievement and her birthday. I thought it would be fun to ask kind internet strangers to congratulate and say a few good words or share advice/tips to my friend. Can you share them as comments to this thread, and I will create a physical scrapbook of reddit encouragement comments to share with her on her birthday tomorrow?Thanks in advance!!","My friend who is a lovely human being just finished paying the last payment on her $50k student debt and is now debt free a day before her 31st birthday!

"I've been friends with this guy from across the country for 2 or 3 years now, and I feel like he's been causing me pain for a while now.  I truly thought I enjoyed his company, but now it feels like a redundant step down morally.  He somehow manages to make everyone think he's enjoyable to talk to.  Meanwhile everyone in the Xbox party is being told why their bad or why he's not playing now and it's your fault.  I don't want to end a friendship with someone that's been a part of my life for so long, but him and everyone else on there keeps dragging me back.  It's practicality become an addiction to get on Xbox the second I get home instead of practicing guitar or working out, stuff I want to do.  Even when I thought I could trust him for good advice when I told him that I was depressed he said some bullshit about, ""depression isn't real,"" and ""most people are just looking for pity.""  It's degrading to talk to him, and his posy.  I just don't know if it's worth it to abandon years of voices and personalities for something I'm not even sure if I have the commitment to do.  What do you guys think?","I've been friends with this guy from across the country for 2 or 3 years now, and I feel like he's been causing me pain for a while now.

"Some background: I work inventory for a website that sells trading cards, and I've been mildly crushing on a coworker for awhile now. She's nice, funny, quiet, shy, cute, and from the little bit we've interacted she seems like an interesting person. We haven't interacted much outside of passing conversation because I'm also a pretty quiet and shy person, so the few times I've had the chance I've never been able to think of a way to interact with her without it seeming very forced or making it awkward for one or both of us. The crush level has gone up recently because she got me a cheesecake platter for my birthday. Not an unusual thing as she's always bringing in cookies for everyone but it made my day all the same. I've got the chance to return the favor, but it's not under quite the best of circumstances; She's got a surgery scheduled for this week, and while it's not major she's said she's still really scared (Can't blame her). Add in her having a bout of the flu and she's been in a pretty bad place the last few weeks.I decided to get her something to cheer her up and settled on making her cannoli (I saw from a FB post of hers that she liked it) and spent the last few days carefully finding out her favorite flavors and any food allergies she may have without directly asking her.","Some background: I work inventory for a website that sells trading cards, and I've been mildly crushing on a coworker for awhile now.

"I've been away from school for a few years dealing with personal things and now I'm finally deciding to go back. I have a lot of doubts and insecurities about how much money I'm spending on a degree that might not actually do me any good, especially since I took a few years off from getting it. But this is not a decision I'm making lightly, and it's one I've spent many many nights thinking about. It seems every time I bring up these fears with people they advise me to keep waiting until I'm sure, or to think about getting a different degree. They love me and are trying to support me, but I think they miss the point... and I've only felt worse since I began making these fears known. To clarify I'm going back for a science BA in geology, a passion of mine. Any sort of words of positivity or encouragement would go a long way for me. I try my best to be an optimist, but lately I feel very pessimistic about this very big deal in my life that I was originally looking so forward to.

"Hi all! I think this is a really neat subreddit, just found y'all.I'm talking to a friend and her father tomorrow about a job at their (essentially family) company. I plan to tell them that I'll only work part-time because I want to pursue a Master's degree with reduced tuition, which requires being an employee of the University I attended. I think they'll be disappointed I only plan to go on part-time, but my passion isn't in that work, and I'm not pressed for cash right now. Ideally, a job will open at the University in student services (my desired career field) soon! They're on a hiring freeze due to COVID-19.I could just use some encouragement that the conversation with them will be fine, and that I'll end up enjoying my time there. I'm nervous about letting them down.","Hi all!

"I quit my job yesterday. My first act as an unemployed 23 year old was to make a Reddit account. Some back story, I've been employed since 16 got my first job working seasonal at a local GameStop. I moved up the ranks for about 2.5 years and then quit to make more money at Verizon. That only lasted about a year until I moved to Xfinity for about 9 month. Made a ton of money but the environment was cripplingly toxic. Ended up working in a dialysis clinic and getting my medical assistant cert. Was never passionate about medical I just new it would be a respected title and could pay the bills. After about 9 months of grueling work both emotionally and physically I took a full time position as a CMA in outpatient for a hospital. This job lasted just short of year an a half when I found out I would be let go under the new buyers of the hospital due to changing certification standards. Mind you I hated this job so this wasn't a bad thing, I was excited. I immediately hoped on indeed and applied for a position at Super Supplements just to get a job.","I quit my job yesterday.

"- (I dont speak fluent English since its not my native language I grew up with. Please forgive me for any grammatical errors)-A year and a half ago I came across a post on the sub Reddit randomly.Im not sure who wrote it, but what I do remember is someone mentioning take a hobby or make a goal for improving ones life.To help with depression and suicidal thoughtsI was feeling so low in my life, feeling so tired and unhappy.I had no idea what the point of life was, being alive I mean.I just wished I didnt exist I wish I wasnt born.Life seemed hard and I wanted no part of it.Anyways the post encouraged me enough to at least try some thing that I wanted to do. Growing up movies were my escape, fantasy, sci-fi l, action movies.All were better than my life and the older I got the more I wanted to spend time in those worlds than our own.I just thought maybe Ill start a blog doing movie reviews.... A few friends of mine came over for dinner and we got into shit talking and some how landed on doing a YouTube channel We all loved movies and I thought what the heck why not? Whats the worst that could happen?It doesnt get popular, no one watches us... But I can at least say, hey I gave it a shot, even though it failed Im glad I wont have to wonder what could have been Anyways I threw my entire free time into this project building the website creating the YouTube channel learning how to do graphics, design, effects, and sound A year later I fell in love with this project.No we didnt take off and become youtube famous.But on the other hand the most important thing for me is, I got to appreciate life and it feels good to make something with my own two hands and be able to say I did this.I made this and brought into the world I have no idea who the person was who encouraged me to pursue a hobby like this.Whoever you were, if you ever read this I just want to say thank you from the bottom of my heartI also want to thank this community for continuing to encourage me even though Ive never posted on here. Many of us read all the conversations and posts so thank you :) this is a much needed community and place for a lot of us to find encouragement Anyways heres my YouTube channel its been a year!","- (I dont speak fluent English since its not my native language I grew up with.

"I'm actually relatively young (26) , and I'm an artist. But for months I've been more and more fearful of the concept of retirement due to ageing, and ageing in general, I guess. The idea that unless rejuvenation sciencie gets as far as expected, my body will start giving in against my will and I will be forced to stop doing what I like.Is it possible to be efficiently active and old?

The idea that unless rejuvenation sciencie gets as far as expected, my body will start giving in against my will and I will be forced to stop doing what I like.Is it possible to be efficiently active and old?

"I'm 19, I weigh 235 lb I used to be 250 at the beginning of the year, but it's really hard to keep exercising. Just today I was at the gym not 10 minutes ago and a couple of super skinny super hot girls just snickered at me. Part of it's probably because I'm paranoid but I feel like they were saying look at the fat girl trying to be like us Jesus Christ she doesn't f****** belong here. And so I ran home. I don't know if I can keep going to the gym and having those negative experiences. I'm just to anxiety-ridden and depressed to not go to the gym but at the same time when it's making those symptoms worse... I don't know I just need some encouragement.","I'm 19, I weigh 235 lb I used to be 250 at the beginning of the year, but it's really hard to keep exercising.

"At 13, i was desperate enough to give up my BODY for some company. And it wasn't until i was 15, still alone and in misery, having attempted suicide 7 times in my life, that I realized something.The only thing worth living for was the enjoyment i gave up. I gave up my life for talent. And now, as i watch people tell me that they have no talent, and that nobody could love them, it hurts. I would give up so much to be bad at something again! To be able to scream loudly in the car or use all my paint just to draw something dumb. I would give up my life for some childish enjoyment.Even now, i have a hard time finding ways to feel alive, even if I've given up things like talent,, and the fear of being alone still haunts me every time i open my mouth to sing or pick up a pen to draw,, but i want everyone to remember something,,,Don't give up your happiness for approval. Dance badly in the rain, sing to your favorite song on the radio! Finger paint some fuckin' caterpillars. Annoy the shit out of people, and have the best damn time doing it. Because you are so much more than a talent.","At 13, i was desperate enough to give up my BODY for some company.

Can someone help encourage me so I can forgive this mistake and stop worrying?&#x200B;I made a big mistake at work yesterday, and was corrected by a coworker. I work at a bank where we need to verify every customer that calls in. I started at this job 2 months ago, and I received a call that I'd never dealt with before. A girl called in from a check-cashing place saying the employee there had told her to call us and verify a check. I wasn't sure what they meant at first, and so they clarified. The company had an account with us so I pulled it up and saw there was no money in the account. I totally fucked up and told the girl that the account had a 0 balance and that she won't be able to cash the check and she needs to call her employer.","&#x200B;Wall of text incoming.

"So I go into survival mode and wind back upstairs. During this time from Wednesday to Sunday, I am uncomfortable and nervous. I am under the impression that I''m allowed to leave by myself but not with my son. He finally agrees that the hurricane is no longer a threat and that I could go home. I did allow him to see my son, and try to co-parent like he wished but after picking up my son on Tuesday morning and experiencing how my partner was still being aggressive with me, I finally realized how my emotional and physical safety was at risk.I called the police and reported the domestic dispute and he was eventually arrested and forced to do anger management.&amp;#x200B;After everything had happened, I decided to reconnect with him and try again. I knew this was a bad idea, but I wanted a family and I wanted my son to grow up with family. BIG MISTAKE. As soon as this happened, day by day, my partner was showing his true colors again.","So I go into survival mode and wind back upstairs.

"She was leading me on for a month and a half and I thought I was really getting somewhere. The fact that she tried to feel that way for me and couldnt made everything worse. I know this may sound irrational but I cant help feel that there is something wrong with me and that Im screwed up and thats why this happened to me.

On top of all this, I had a falling out with one of my best friends and he turned some of my other friends against me. I just cant help but feel like everything bad that happens in my life is a direct result of my actions. I had no reason to think that the girl I was talking to would have liked me in the first place. We were barely friends before but after I asked for her number we got really close. She said the reason she doesnt want to make our relationship anything more is because she doesnt want to destroy the relationship we have right now. I dont know how true that actually is.

"Hi all, I'm a nurse, working in the time of Covid. All politics aside, its just a really hard time to be a nurse. Long hours, frayed tempers, everyone is on edge. I'm just fried, and I miss my coping mechanisms of pedicures, massages, and spa days. They've been replaced by activities like hiking and meditation - its fun, but it's not what I really want. I come from a big family. We must update each other every week on how we have been. Negative points if you don't make the weekly Skype. Even more negative if you dont 'bring it'and show how you are 'crushing Covid.'I'm so tired. I have about 10% gas left in my tank. I just need a smile, or a nod, or a 'sup' just to say that regardless of where we are, it's going to be okay.","Hi all, I'm a nurse, working in the time of Covid.

"Feeling very hopeless. Followed my partner to a big city for his job, quit mine, thought I would find work quick. It's been almost 6 months. I have no more savings, we have his income and health benefits now, but we are still struggling on one income.I have had a few interviews and I never get a call back. I have applied at some clothing stores, too, but they don't even call me for an interview. I am looking for a career, though, not a part-time job. I have also applied for key holders, reception, teaching (I have a TEFL certificate) , in theatre (I have a degree), but there are no call backs for me. I have 7 years landscaping with 2 of those as supervisor, and 1 being on my own. I don't have a degree in landscape design (just experience) nor do I have a florist certificate (which I am getting but it does cost almost 3300 CAD). I have had 2 interviews with a floral shop and a few via email and they always ghost me when they ask to see photos. I have tons of experience from landscaping making planters for all seasons. I also understand variety, textures, colours etc I am just bogged down by no one giving me a chance. I built a bouquet at an interview and she said she was so impressed, and despite telling me she'd call back, she just ghosted me.

"So we've been together for a long time and it's more than passed the time of considering whether or not to pop the question, and I can't do it. As nice as our life is, it's comfortable, predictable, and unfulfilling. I've been having these thoughts for a long time but couldn't trust my own judgement. I worry that I'm throwing away an easy lifestyle and a beautiful woman who cares about me. I'm not a total jerk, I do care about her, but I've been having this feeling in my gut that I need to end it. To the point of getting depressed and withdrawing from friends and activities I enjoy. Part of it is the fear of uncertainty and part is me not wanting to hurt her. My heart and my gut say we're not right for each other but almost psychologically I just can't do it. Please encourage me to do the right thing.","So we've been together for a long time and it's more than passed the time of considering whether or not to pop the question, and I can't do it.

Part of it is the fear of uncertainty and part is me not wanting to hurt her. My heart and my gut say we're not right for each other but almost psychologically I just can't do it. Please encourage me to do the right thing."
"My dream job got shut down, I can't go to school to take classes in person for my extremely hands-on major, and my backup job at a barbershop has been closed down now too. Aside from occasionally seeing my friends (which I know I shouldn't be doing in the first place) there's not much that makes me feel whole. I waste my time on dating apps and hooking up with people who don't care about me and it's negatively affecting my self image. At the beginning of the year I felt like I could take on the whole world. Right now all I want to do is cry in bed.","My dream job got shut down, I can't go to school to take classes in person for my extremely hands-on major, and my backup job at a barbershop has been closed down now too.

"I have a shitty job and a very unsupportive family. While having dinner, I told them about my plans to leave my full time job and build my own career on freelancing. Not even a minute in my explanation and theyve already bombarded me with a lot of questions and doubt. I know freelancing is hard like really really hard but its something that makes me happy (I currently have a part time job which is essentially what Ill be doing as a freelancer) and I know starting from the very beginning will be extremely hard but Im mentally prepared for it. Ive also saved enough money to live for a year which Im confident that Ill be able to get clients by then. It just hurts to know that none of the people I consider the closest to me support me in what I want to do. Its seriously taking a toll to my mental health. Ive been wanting to do this since last year but I just didnt have the right skills and financial stability yet. Now I know Im ready but it feels like its dragging me down with all the doubt that my family has around me. I easily get affected by what other people tell me which sucks big time. Im currently organizing my portfolio and other starting a freelancing career stuff right now and feeling really depressed. Uplift me please?

I am a struggling makeup student for 3 years and I finally got my first paid job for working on set for a short film. I was extremely anxious over it and stayed in a hotel for 4 days just to get some work experience which I never thought I could do this early on in my course. I did it and smashed it and I wasnt tagged in the promo post by the director who is also a student btw when he tagged everyone else. My parents werent too fussed either. I thought this was gonna be this massive achievement but now I feel like maybe I shouldnt feel so proud of myself as I am.,I am a struggling makeup student for 3 years and I finally got my first paid job for working on set for a short film.

"Ive been on a downward spiralMy fianc and I have moved in together at the start of 2020, which either highlighted or exposed some major dependency issues that she has. On top of that, her mental health has been beyond terrible for herwhich is likely a huge driving force for the dependencyand Ive gotten Caregivers Fatigue 3 or 4 times already. I desperately want to communicate this issue but she can already read it off of me (been together for a long time) which is making her mental health worse at times, and I think if we were to outright have that conversation it would cause her mental health to be even worse. She also gets upset that it seems like I view her as helpless and unable to function without me, and admittedly I do because shes so extremely needyI hate myself physically. Literally from my head to my toes: I cant find a good haircut and the barber that I helped out with that couldnt be consistent, then COVID hit and Im out a barber &amp; reference point for my hair. Im in too low of a funk to consistently care about maintaining my beard which is as frustrating as daily care would be. Ive been gaining fat all of 2020 which not only do I want to lose weight but Im also a nutrition major so thats not a good look.","Ive been on a downward spiralMy fianc and I have moved in together at the start of 2020, which either highlighted or exposed some major dependency issues that she has.

"Could use a morale booster. I [M 23] hit it off with a girl, and shes been great. Her work is getting really difficult right now and she keeps saying sorry, and I keep saying its okay, so I sent her some encouraging things throughout the day.

Dont want to hit her with the let me know if Im talking too much shtick, because the last thing I want is to show weakness. Im still feeling insecure about it, as she didnt reply to any of my prior comments except for the very last one. Shes trying to comment, I can see that.

"I have a part-time retail job which admittedly I love, mostly because of an awesome manager. But it's not enough to live on, so I'm planning to get some electrician training. There's always a market for that, they're unionized, and I love working with my hands. So far, so good. I've located a technical college that:\- is less than half an hour from my house (\*super convenient\*)\- has a six-month certificate program (\*not so short that it feels incomplete, not so long that I get frustrated\*)\- offers job placement assistance after graduation (\*SCORE!\*)\- classes start at 7:45 AM (\*record scratch sound effect...\*)Oh dear. There's a reason I work the evening shift. I know this is a petty thing to get hung up on in the face of such an otherwise-perfect opportunity, but it's been a VERY long time since I've been required to get up early on a regular basis. And now I'm on medication with a side effect of insomnia. My current situation is unsustainable, and these early classes will allow me to stick with my usual evening shift; but I have a long history of being easily discouraged and can already feel myself backpedaling. I need someone to talk me out of talking myself out of this.","I have a part-time retail job which admittedly I love, mostly because of an awesome manager.

"I have a tough time connecting with my dad (mom died 18 months ago).  I am on the fence about whether my husband and I should really be together.

Problem is, I have a son and I know I need to open up and show him how a person can connect.  I don't really know where I need to go but I wish the guys from Queer eye could come and just fix my life in a week.  I guess I just have to do that for myself.  I think I need to force myself to go out and talk to other people and do things to bring me in to connection with the world.  I just feel like hiding under a blanket for the rest of my life.  I of course can't do that.  Wish I could be different as I constantly don't like myself.  Not really sure what I'm asking.","I have a tough time connecting with my dad (mom died 18 months ago).

I tried to help with as much money as I could, but as the weeks progressed I started to feel like an ATM again, she stopped texting, she stopped calling, only when it was time for me to give money would she come back, now we have slowly drifted apart more she didn't come back last week when i got paid.

The police came, and I was delirious but not combative, since I had collapsed. During the ambulance ride and for several hours afterwards I was hearing voices. My legs and arms were cuffed to a bed for the entire night. They position you in a certain uncomfortable position so you cant reach your hands close enough together to grab/use anything. I was so convinced that this was Hell, that I used my teeth to pull a cord coming from a nearby monitor and wrapped it around my neck to try to strangle myself.My sense of time became massively warped. It felt like I was in that hospital for 300 years. I eventually calmed down enough that they actually approved to release me.","Blood everywhere. Its left a couple scars.

"She wouldn't let me move on to the elite choir, though I auditioned every year and had a high score. My friend let me see her scores, and they were so low and she got in. I tried to do the local vocal competitions twice, and both times she would flake on my time slot for practice and then eventually advised me to withdraw from the competition. I moved on to college. I got into a really great college known for their theater program. I wanted to be a musical theater major and eventually sing on a stage in front of people. But that was a very hard time in my life and I ended up getting kicked out of college for not being able to play. I took work in factories and got married and kind of gave up on that dream. But, I still sing all the time. I hide in the bathroom and sing karaoke on my phone. I learn a new song once a month or so just to test my voice. I try to do twitch sings on my stream sometimes, but I know it's not my best and I'm a small fish so my audience is about 3 people.:P And I'm ok with that. I just want for once in my life to blow an audience away. XD When we have finances, I want to get vocal lessons. I'm working on my weight, I'm morbidly obese so doing community theater right now seems unlikely. What would you guys suggest to get the response I'm looking for when I sing?","She wouldn't let me move on to the elite choir, though I auditioned every year and had a high score.

"Hey all. My girlfriend and I just adopted a rescue dog (German Sheppard) and brought her home yesterday.

We've both had tough dogs before, but it's been a stressful time in general so it is extra tough at the moment. Thanks! <3","Hey all.

"Ive been feeling kinda down and ugly lately. If you check my profile, you would see that a lot of the recent stuff I posted is similar in idea. I really want to talk to my crush but it would never work out because hes way out of my league. And Im serious. He plays baseball so hes fit, hes super super smart (AP classes! And he never does the precalc hw but he does great every test), hes humble (when I told him I got a hundred on my English midterm, he seemed genuinely happy even thought hes in much higher level classes than me), and hes fairly attractive.Ugh, hes probably the most mischievous little person around his friends and then hes nice- almost shy- with people that arent his friends.  And his face turns bright red, its adorable. He would never like me back. My friends say Im pretty but I think theyre lying. Im not the dumbest (my precalc grade would argue otherwise) and Ill admit Im in honor classes and Ive got a poem published in a book but thats about it. I try to stay fit too so its not like, health wise, were super different. I dont think it could ever work out anyways and I dont think his friends would approve of him dating me and I also think that  he would probably go chase the pretty girls that are also in the AP classes and equally as smart as him. I dont know what to do anymore. Hes all this cool stuff and Im just me and I wish he wasnt so out of my league. Im 16 btw if that changes anything ","Ive been feeling kinda down and ugly lately.

"And just when the company was supposed to call me for joining, Covid happened. Hope diminished, Loan EMI still going on which my father pays, lost out on peace. Its then I began to ponder on my identity and what I relied on. And I found the answer in a verse from bible, Romans 8:28~ and we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose The responsibility I have is to shift my identity and put it in God, because God is permanent. When I put my identity , of who I am in something permanent thats when there is no fear of losing peace, thats when I have nothing to be anxious of. Doesnt it answer our fundamental question. We lose so much of our lives in giving and focusing on temporary needs and dont realise the grave danger of losing out on hope. I found the answer in this Covid 19 situation and somehow Im grateful that I realised it. Im regaining my peace during the madness around me and I want to leave you with this exhortation to shift your identity to Jesus. Because all it took was a pandemic to shift mine in something permanent..","And just when the company was supposed to call me for joining, Covid happened.

"I have been working since I was 14 (picking fruit on farms during the summer for 2 years) and on my own since 19 (I'm 32). I really hate relying on people and as this point I'm forced to because all my savings are gone. I come from a poorer family and they don't have money to share. I was so excited for the move because I honestly thought I had a great resume, and an awesome portfolio (for landscape design). I have reached out to the design companies in my area and never recieved a courtesy email back. I do have a lot of anxiety so cold calling, and calling back multiple times (especially when they have ignored me once) makes it super hard. I don't have a lot of people I can talk to because I don't want to bug my friends and family anymore. I'm always complaining about the same things... I am trying to find a therapist, but we only have coverage for maybe 2 or 3 visits. I'm trying to find someone who will work on a sliding scale because 2 visits isn't enough and I want to stick with the same person if I like them. Anyway. Not sure if this is in the right place.... Just needed to vent. TL DR: followed partner to city for his job... Quit mine...  can't find one. Now I'm jobless and sad.","I have been working since I was 14 (picking fruit on farms during the summer for 2 years) and on my own since 19 (I'm 32).

Not even a minute in my explanation and theyve already bombarded me with a lot of questions and doubt. I know freelancing is hard like really really hard but its something that makes me happy (I currently have a part time job which is essentially what Ill be doing as a freelancer) and I know starting from the very beginning will be extremely hard but Im mentally prepared for it. Ive also saved enough money to live for a year which Im confident that Ill be able to get clients by then. It just hurts to know that none of the people I consider the closest to me support me in what I want to do. Its seriously taking a toll to my mental health. Ive been wanting to do this since last year but I just didnt have the right skills and financial stability yet. Now I know Im ready but it feels like its dragging me down with all the doubt that my family has around me. I easily get affected by what other people tell me which sucks big time. Im currently organizing my portfolio and other starting a freelancing career stuff right now and feeling really depressed. Uplift me please?

"I am studying to get a bachelors degree and currently have a month of examinations in my school and I am beyond tired. I am also working 24 hours per week at job so I could live on my own, pay the bills, pay for food. Not a dream job, but it pays the bills.

I like my studies because it is finally something I am very much interested in (except tomorrows exam, but it's only a small part of everything). Still it is hard. I wrote myself a letter in the beginning in autumn that was delivered to my during this hard time of exams. I had forgotten about it and I was very moved when I received it. My past self says that she hops that I am just as inspired as she is at the moment and hopes I am getting enough rest and she is very proud of me. The last part is the one that moved me so much, I think I just don't get enough reassurement that I am doing enough. I should not be depending on other's peoples reassurement though, but my own, is it not right?

"I'm so lost. I moved back home (3 states away) to move in with my brother (and his wife and toddler) when my previous job stopped paying the bills. I was told to take my time, do what's right for me, and not to leave until I actually had money in savings again. I am taking a computer course that ends in an apprenticeship in June/July. I have a waitressing job 4 days a week. The money has fallen to $60/shift in tips plus a paltry $4/hr. It's a daytime waitressing position, as I have the tendency to become extremely unproductive during the day and drink to excess when I'm off at 10pm or later. It's happened countless times.Beyond that, I find it nearly impossible to live with a stranger. The last two roommates I have had that I didn't really know have ended badly. This is why I moved in with my brother and his family. I babysit with little to no advance notice a few times a week (for free of course). I try to stay in my room and not make a mess. I try to get up with my niece and let my brother and sister sleep in when I am able. I haven't even been there 6 months.","I'm so lost.

And I'd be lying if I didn't say I feel like the rug has been pulled from out beneath me. Maybe they thought I was doing better than I was actually doing. The truth is that talking about my illness stresses out my SIL. My brother offered to listen but every time I try to talk to him he just walks away. So I've only been telling them good things.","My sister in law expressed that she wanted me out last night. After they encourage me to go to my best friend's wedding in another state and get involved in a local sport (which cost money), I was informed that she was pissed that I had bought sports equipment the other night and that it was becoming time for me to leave. She wasn't mean about it. She just stated that it was time for her to have her space back. I'm worried that after all the changes I have been making, I'm back where I started.

"Hey there everyone! I am a Russian guy who desperately tries to get a driving license for himself but have failed miserably 3 times already. I am here for the 4th time trying to get into the right mindset to I finally accomplish what I want today but I am awfully nervous. The thing is that when I drive with an instructor from driving school where I went, I feel at ease and I relatively good at it but when it comes to passing the test and I have an officer riding shotgun who observes me driving, assessing me, I am get all messed up. I get so nervous that my mouth becomes dry, palms sweat, feet shake and I just cant get my mind straight. I am so mad because of that. I know that I have enough skill to pass the test but this nervousness gets the best of me. Please, encourage.Edit: thanks for kind words, everyone! I passed! I cant describe how helpful your kind words were. Thanks a lot! I am grateful to have Reddit installed on my phone, Jesus Christ. I can rest now.","Hey there everyone!

"I try to comfort him and tell him that wasn't true. He starts pushing me and yelling out loud that I'm trash and a liar. I'm trying to defend myself and he tells me to shut the fuck up. We walk to the car and while driving I tell him that he was being ridiculous and getting upset over non-trivial things once again. He proceeds to slap my phone off of my stand in my car and stomp on it. I become irate and start telling him how I didn't appreciate him destroying property. We get back to his mother's house and she can tell something is wrong with me. So, I ask to speak to her one on one to show her what he did to my phone. Instead of letting me talk in private he intrudes on our conversation and starts antagonizing me telling me that I don't know how to keep my mouth shut and our business is between me and him.","I try to comfort him and tell him that wasn't true.

I am a struggling makeup student for 3 years and I finally got my first paid job for working on set for a short film. I was extremely anxious over it and stayed in a hotel for 4 days just to get some work experience which I never thought I could do this early on in my course. I did it and smashed it and I wasnt tagged in the promo post by the director who is also a student btw when he tagged everyone else. My parents werent too fussed either. I thought this was gonna be this massive achievement but now I feel like maybe I shouldnt feel so proud of myself as I am.,I am a struggling makeup student for 3 years and I finally got my first paid job for working on set for a short film.

"So, I've been best friends for a year and a half with a girl(I am a guy) and I'm talking the kind of friendship that we can tell each other anything and everything and know that the other isn't going to judge and is just there to listen and give advice.In November I finally told her that I had feelings for her after debating in my head for 4 months. She said she also had feelings for me and we were proud of each other for finally letting it out. However, ever since then it feels like there is a rift in the friendship that I had zero intention of creating, you see, I never fully wanted to get into a relationship as she had just started her freshman year of college and I am in my Junior year of highschool(we're only a year apart in age) so we were both stressed with school. I was just tired of holding it in and wanted to get it off my chest.As it stands now, we still talk but it's not the same. It's not the deep talks we used to have, she won't talk to me about anything that's bothering her, and there is something, she's said so multiple times, I just can't get her to open up anymore. I don't know what I did or how to fix it and it's driving me crazy and it's making me feel like giving up on everything. She's the kind of friend that I really don't want to lose and would rather keep as a best friend than ruin that by getting into a relationship. If anyone has any advice at all, it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.","So, I've been best friends for a year and a half with a girl(I am a guy) and I'm talking the kind of friendship that we can tell each other anything and everything and know that the other isn't going to judge and is just there to listen and give advice.In November I finally told her that I had feelings for her after debating in my head for 4 months.

"I'm in a very strange period right now and I'm still trying to figure it out, but I'll try to describe it the best I can. Events in chronological order:During the quarantine, I took the time to workout and eat better. I had the discipline and the determination to lose weight and get fitter.Since June, work has been stressful, because of upcoming deadlines. I got me in a procrastination-due-to-anxiety state. My work isn't great, but it's not terrible either. I'm planning on getting at least decent results before July.This weekend, we got very bad news in the family.Since then, I feel like I want to lose control of my life. A small and easy way to do it was to completely wreck my quarantine habits. I've been eating like an absolute mess and haven't worked-out at all for the last few days. I also haven't touched my musical instruments, which I normally practice pretty much every day. Everything is less fun, less interesting, less joyful, etc. I can be distracted for a while, but my energy level and general happiness is much lower than usual. Do you guys have any advice or encouragement?","I'm in a very strange period right now and I'm still trying to figure it out, but I'll try to describe it the best I can.

The whole table let out a huge roar as if Bernie Mac made the best joke ever... so much laughter, pointing their fingers, laughing with unchewed food in their mouth. You an actress? You dont even have the looks! Fast forward to now, people still call me average and say Im nothing special. Tbh, I feel very damaged and dont feel any joy or even like trying. Ive met with other actors who have also called me average and said Im fat. Idk what to do. Im not really accepting I look average.. i dont think I do. Im not fat.","It didnt make sense to me.

And his face turns bright red, its adorable. He would never like me back. My friends say Im pretty but I think theyre lying.

I've had another fairly bad episode this past week and I'm worried about my job. I'm worried about what my coworkers think. I'm worried about pretty much everything to be honest. The list is endless. I guess what I'm asking is for some comforting words of encouragement that everything won't implode and even if it does it won't always be that way."
"I feel like I've been getting positive vibes.1.

Wake up in her bed and she makes me breakfast.)3. Is hosting this Karaoke and invites me, of course I come.  Hugs me more than normal people hug (I'm a hugger and its more than I would do.) Also, keeps looking at me.4.ect.....But I get dumb in my brain sometimes cause anxiety and depression.....Like I'm pretty sure that all I have to do is be ""Hey grrrr, What up?"" but I don't because reasons.Maybe words of encouragement from Rando Calrissian might help me get over myself and be like ""Grrrrr, What up?""","I feel like I've been getting positive vibes.1.

"So I knew I had enough....but when I saw I only had $8. My heart sank....because....I'm the type of person who never buys anything for myself because I have always been broke. I have been scammed out of money through my parents. I have had precious items sold from under my nose by family.....I once had a $100 electoric guitar and $50 amp bought for christmas one year....I didn't even have that for a year. I went to school one day came back and it was gone. My older brother walks in and said he had to sell my guitar and amp to help pay for his rent which was a joke cause he was doing drugs at the time. I was taught by my foster parents that everything had a price for it even if it was a gift so I get really anxious when someone gives me a gift cause I think, ""Oh shit what's the price for taking this?"" I just... I felt really bad that even though I was able to get like $14 of drinks and two cool bracelets too. I felt bad cause I was telling my two friends I was planning on buy pizza for them and cake even though it was for a late birthday party for me but I felt like such a idiot cause I wanted to proved something for them too and I .... I blabbed about it.......I know it's dumb for getting upset about something like this.....but I was just wanting to give myself a party and just not have other people worry about costs of food cause i want to prove for others and just have fun and relax.....but I got so upset at myself cause I wasn't able to get the stuff I just cancelled everything.....And now I'm just getting drunk on my own to just forget how fucking stupid I can be at times.....I'm......

"I'm 31. I was diagnosed this Tuesday with prediabetes and high cholesterol. They put me on statins. I wasn't surprised. I'm 360lbs and 5'5.I have PCOS and my hormones have always been awful. I don't have periods, never did even when I was smaller. I can probably grow a mustache and beard. The upkeep is frustrating. I have always felt worthless. I was getting gal bladder attacks regularly for 3 years but I thought I was faking it for sympathy. I spent several months trying to get the pain diagnosed. My job fired me for absences, even though I scheduled them and got written permission. Temp manufacturing work. 1 year and a half. Didn't matter. 1 week later I was hospitalized. Almost died. Several surgeries to remove my gallbladder and several stones. When I got home I should've done physical therapy. I was always active. I put on weight. 100 lbs. I tried to do call centers. Found out that years of emotional abuse had made it so I just sob when customers yell at me.","I'm 31. I was diagnosed this Tuesday with prediabetes and high cholesterol. They put me on statins.

"Just looking for some encouraging words. My father is dying -we think based on his deteriorating heath for many years and age, and that he never really reaches out to us. He has been reaching out to each of my siblings to get together. It has fallen to me to arrange this. Im the youngest of 6, thought we are all in our late 30s and older. None of us is particularly close with him, so I didnt think this would be hard, but damn if it isnt really hard.   ","Just looking for some encouraging words.

"My sister in law expressed that she wanted me out last night. After they encourage me to go to my best friend's wedding in another state and get involved in a local sport (which cost money), I was informed that she was pissed that I had bought sports equipment the other night and that it was becoming time for me to leave. She wasn't mean about it. She just stated that it was time for her to have her space back. I'm worried that after all the changes I have been making, I'm back where I started. I'm in a job that can't sustain me financially. I don't know how I'm going to afford my bills if I move out by February. I know that I can't work any more than 4 days a week with my current class load and my mental health issues. I can't get treatment now because I can't afford to pay for it. And I'd be lying if I didn't say I feel like the rug has been pulled from out beneath me. Maybe they thought I was doing better than I was actually doing. The truth is that talking about my illness stresses out my SIL. My brother offered to listen but every time I try to talk to him he just walks away. So I've only been telling them good things.","My sister in law expressed that she wanted me out last night.

"Ive been on a downward spiralMy fianc and I have moved in together at the start of 2020, which either highlighted or exposed some major dependency issues that she has. On top of that, her mental health has been beyond terrible for herwhich is likely a huge driving force for the dependencyand Ive gotten Caregivers Fatigue 3 or 4 times already. I desperately want to communicate this issue but she can already read it off of me (been together for a long time) which is making her mental health worse at times, and I think if we were to outright have that conversation it would cause her mental health to be even worse. She also gets upset that it seems like I view her as helpless and unable to function without me, and admittedly I do because shes so extremely needyI hate myself physically. Literally from my head to my toes: I cant find a good haircut and the barber that I helped out with that couldnt be consistent, then COVID hit and Im out a barber & reference point for my hair. Im in too low of a funk to consistently care about maintaining my beard which is as frustrating as daily care would be. Ive been gaining fat all of 2020 which not only do I want to lose weight but Im also a nutrition major so thats not a good look.","Ive been on a downward spiralMy fianc and I have moved in together at the start of 2020, which either highlighted or exposed some major dependency issues that she has.

"A lot of people have told me that most people fail their first time, but it really doesn't make me feel better about it. The lady testing me tried to get me to reschedule for Monday (which has already passed) but i wanted to see my school councilor about it first. Unfortunately, this week is the dreaded standardized testing week so I don't think I'm gonna be able to see her, and I honestly don't think I can handle my job any longer. I'm really stuck between a rock and a hard place here. On one hand: i really need to take that next step forward towards the plan I have going, but I also feel so so embarassed and i don't want to see that lady again because she had to see me cry. I'd go to a different driving school but I'd have to pay more at a new place than I'd have to for a retake. My only real choice here is to stand up and do it.Can anyone please give me the encouragement to call back and try again next week? I really need it.","A lot of people have told me that most people fail their first time, but it really doesn't make me feel better about it.

"It was then, I realized, I didnt want to live my life anymore. So I got help, and it was through that help I got to where I am today. I left that crowd behind, I gained control over alcohol and I actively pushed for my education cause at the end of the day I know I had a goal in mind of becoming a Neurosurgeon or just getting into D.O or M.D. school. So I went hard back to work and brought my grades up. My gpa at the end of my junior year was a 1.9 overall and now it sits at a 2.69. Now I know by no means, does this make me a competitive student or applicant despite my upward trend. Most of the time I read on websites for most schools and it requires a minimum of 3.0 to even be considered. I have the required hours and credits to graduate UAB with a degree in psychology.","It was then, I realized, I didnt want to live my life anymore.

"So short story is I am a 40yo married man who has fallen in love with Jade (name changed) who is a 20yo deaf Chinese girl who works as a sex worker.Yes I know...Pre covid I would pay Jade for sex  once a week, and we would chat during the week on wechat using its translation function. I have tried to learn Chinese sign language but have found it really hard.Sometimes we would go for dinner or drinks which was off the clock. Jade knows that I am married and that I will never leave my with. Jade and I have talked about our relationship and agreed we are friends. I think about her every day and sometimes wish I could be with her, but we only get one life to live.For most of this year we have not met but still chat regularly. I hope I can see her again soon.There are plenty of places I can go for criticism and Understand that, but if there is anyone who has a few words of encouragement it would be appreciated.If this post is met with silence, thats ok.","So short story is I am a 40yo married man who has fallen in love with Jade (name changed) who is a 20yo deaf Chinese girl who works as a sex worker.Yes I know...Pre covid I would pay Jade for sex  once a week, and we would chat during the week on wechat using its translation function.

"As of two weeks ago, I was finally able to wear the dress out in public and wore it for D&amp;D!2) This morning, I hesitated to try on the corset, fearing that I was still too large. Eventually, I gave in. I pulled on my thick long-sleeve shirt and held the corset over my head. I fought to put it on by myself for a minute or so before it fell seamlessly down my chest and over my torso.Ladies, gentlemen, and those who can't make up their minds, I'm happy to say that I can finally wear the article of clothing I was afraid of wearing most. Still wearing it even as I type! I couldn't possibly feel any more proud of the progress I'm making, but I know I'm not done yet. I'll post more milestones as they come. Small victories today for a healthier tomorrow.","As of two weeks ago, I was finally able to wear the dress out in public and wore it for D&amp;D!2) This morning, I hesitated to try on the corset, fearing that I was still too large.

"Cooking, cleaning, planning meals, doing odd jobs for money. Ive lost everything it feels like but our room mate is covering us for now.

I just don't know how possible that is, or even if it's possible at all. I had so many dreams as a kid of things I wanted to be when I grew up.

I've always dreamed about living on my own and being independent with a career that I love. I don't want to get married and have kids (I'm not against those things, I just don't want them) and I don't want to have to do that simply because I'm female and Autistic. I feel the need to prove even if it's just to myself that I'm capable of more then cooking, cleaning, and making babies. I want to achieve my dream of being independent and having a career.

"Hey guys I'm August of 2018 I started the process of joining the USAF and it's been kind of stressful. I went MEPs(Military Entrance Processing Station) couple months back and got medically disqualified for something called Subtalar Ankylosis, I have no medical history or this and I feel as though I have been misdiagnosed. However I was told that I could get a waiver to join the USAF and that waiver has to be approved by the Surgeon General of the Air Force. My file was sent up last week and I don't know how long it will be and I am so worried I am going to get denied. People have told me the AF doesn't need recruits right now or that they never approve medical waivers. I'm down about this so any encouragement would be appreciated thanks guys ","Hey guys I'm August of 2018 I started the process of joining the USAF and it's been kind of stressful.

I had to replace my tires recently. Work hasnt paid me back for my travel expenses. Now Im job hunting again and looking for new places to live. Im pretty broke, I cant visit my husband because the drive is so far and challenging and I only have less than 48 hours to make the trip. Im dealing with the loss of my mom, and how Im so unavailable because of my job, but I cant take a break from it because I wont get paid for it. Plus Im just feeling so shitty and unhappy with my body and Im just struggling so much. I know Ill be ok, but like...its just been bad day after bad day. Im a very positive person and have been handling this well, but Im having a spiral moment. Advice, encouragement and positivity are welcome.

"I've been doing nothing but studying all summer for my last qualifying exam next Tuesday. I had no one to help me. I gave up alcohol and pot because I didn't want to tarnish my memory in any way. I love the outdoors in the summer, but with studying I've had little time for it.So basically I've given everything I love up for an entire summer and dedicated all my energy toward passing this test. I wanted to review this week, but I feel like I have nothing left to give and I'm impatient to get back to the things I love. I've had panic attacks all day.I need some support to help get me through these last overwhelming couple of days.Thanks for reading this.","I've been doing nothing but studying all summer for my last qualifying exam next Tuesday.

"Im 7 months postpartum and having some trouble getting over PPD. Lots of crying lately and being overly sensitive to little things that wouldnt typically bother me. I guess just feeling pretty insecure personally. Also not feeling like myself- I used to do a lot alone like go to the mall, the movies, out to eat. I used to be very tidy and organized. I used to read and crochet. I do almost nothing that I did before I became a mom and now its like everything is about my son and if its not then I feel like a bad mom. Anyways, I just reached out to a girlfriend of mine and asked if she wouldnt mind going out for dinner so I could start trying to get out of the house. Would love some encouragement that this is a good step in the right direction because my heart is actually beating fast from embarrassment.","Im 7 months postpartum and having some trouble getting over PPD.

"Arguing with me over not answering his phone calls when he thought I should, questioning my whereabouts and who I was hanging out with, and arguing with me about how I was disrespectful to him because I made a sarcastic joke or telling me that my facial expressions and tone of voice was disrespecting him, he would blow this out of proportion and make it seem like I'm antagonizing him, when I was just responding to a question he was asking. I asked him how was my tone and he couldn't tell me.&amp;#x200B;The recent dispute happened when I told him he could not have $1000 from my refund check. I did tell him yes earlier in the month, but after thinking and reconsidering his actions and everything that I have endured like paying for daycare for the past 3 months, and finding out he was going to party instead of working like he told me, I decided that I was not handing over any money to him. I cautioned myself and explained to him, I can't give the $1000 because I do not have means to do so right now.

"I've got my recipes and all my ingredients, but my brain (Which is very good at self-sabotage) has come up with an outcome I'm having trouble dealing with. Putting aside the anxiety I'm feeling about just giving them to her, I'm utterly *terrified* she's going to think this is some kind of assholish passive-aggressive one-upmanship because I'm making the cannoli rather than buying it like she did with the cheesecake. I could just buy the cannoli and cut all this out, but tracking down the recipes and making them has and will help with the anxiety about giving them to her. I also feel the situation calls for the extra effort. I'll most likely say this when I give them to her, but that doesn't make the thought go away or the whole thing any less daunting.So have at me r/encouragement.

Ghosted by my college friends when I had a family medical emergency and had to withdraw from school, and my best friend blocked me on everything in December. The only explanation I can think of for getting blocked is that she was hoping this guy (who she said had major insecurity issues) would ask her out, and my assumption is that he made her block me.Student loans are beating me down because I dont know if its financially worth it to shoot for my dream. What good is it if I have to work a job in addition to my career just to pay off my loans?Im just having a rough time, and its getting to meEdit: I also find myself misdirecting my anger because Im so upset with my life.

"So...Today I was planning on giving myself a pizza birthday with anyone who wanted to join on my campus. I only have two friends. I got a check for $100 yesterday that I cashed and I have been looking forward to this all week. Even after my birthday that happened this past Wednesday. I had some bills to pay like hulu and neflix which I didn't mind. But i made sure that I was saving enough to I could buy the stuff. I got on the bus. Got some drinks for myself and I got two bracelets from hot topic too but what I didn't realize was that most of my billing stuff happened today. So I went from $60 to $8 cause I didn't know my netflix bill and hulu bill happened today. So after I bought drinks and two cool bracelets for myself, I didn't have enough money to buy my pizzas. I was at target and I had put two digornio's stuffed cheese pizzas in my cart and I was trying to check my bank finances cause I always get paranoid that money is going to disappear. But I had $40 after I bought my bracelets.","So...Today I was planning on giving myself a pizza birthday with anyone who wanted to join on my campus. I only have two friends.

"Today was a great day. I spent the day at Chuck E. Cheese's with my mother, little brother, and my 3 nieces. Bro and I racked up 5,000+ tickets for the girls to spend on prizes. Came home and finished up NaNoWriMo, getting in all 50k words a day early, even though this month was rife with days so full of depression I wanted to just give up on it entirely and binge watch tv or play video games instead.So actually feeling a little bit more productive than usual. Then I get an email from my boss. So around November 14th, he tells me I need to ""pause"" work until December 5th due to some cash flow issues that he needs to straighten out. I'm not happy with this but I can't do anything about it because I work remotely from home as a contract employee. But today's email tells me that all of my accounts are being deactivated to ""save money"" and that he hopes the team can get up and functional again in January and he hopes I'll be part of the team then.So I'm essentially now unemployed for all of December which means Christmas is going to suck even more than usual, and I'm probably going to spend the next couple of weeks struggling with the heavier bouts of depression and anxiety again.I've been applying for jobs both remote and local for two months now and I haven't gotten anything, no bites at all. It's just really discouraging and I am losing all of my confidence, and maybe I thought reddit would have nice things to say to help cheer me up a little.

"I'm struggling right now in many things. I have a bachelor of science in graphic design, but it's a popular career and I'm just not competitive enough. When my old job falsely accused me of assault, I got a certificate in technical writing to boost my chances at a new job. When I learned I might need to somehow move into a senior community to help out a friend, I got a certificate for in-home senior care so I could be his caretaker. Due to the pandemic, many certification classes are extremely cheap. So I picked up a photoshop class to boost my chances of a side job with graphic design even though the degree should technically cover it.Now I seem to have an ""addiction"" to getting more education and certificates. Im not spending $1000s of dollars for a class so its not like I'm ""spending money I don't have"". As I said, most of these classesare on sale due to schools trying to help either people who were laid off find new skills or people who are in quarantine find new hobbies, and they are usually between $10 and $25 each depending on the class.I ended up picking up classes to get certified in copywriting, dog training, and digital photography on top of what I mentioned above. I'm starting to regret picking up these new skills- like it feels like I'm trying to compensate or fill a void now.Am I biting off more than I can chew here? Am I doing too much? Is there such a thing as too much learning? Should I stop? I could just use a little direction and confirmation that this choice to learn more will not end up disappointing me in the future.","I'm struggling right now in many things.

"Some background: I work inventory for a website that sells trading cards, and I've been mildly crushing on a coworker for awhile now. She's nice, funny, quiet, shy, cute, and from the little bit we've interacted she seems like an interesting person. We haven't interacted much outside of passing conversation because I'm also a pretty quiet and shy person, so the few times I've had the chance I've never been able to think of a way to interact with her without it seeming very forced or making it awkward for one or both of us. The crush level has gone up recently because she got me a cheesecake platter for my birthday. Not an unusual thing as she's always bringing in cookies for everyone but it made my day all the same. I've got the chance to return the favor, but it's not under quite the best of circumstances; She's got a surgery scheduled for this week, and while it's not major she's said she's still really scared (Can't blame her). Add in her having a bout of the flu and she's been in a pretty bad place the last few weeks.I decided to get her something to cheer her up and settled on making her cannoli (I saw from a FB post of hers that she liked it) and spent the last few days carefully finding out her favorite flavors and any food allergies she may have without directly asking her.","Some background: I work inventory for a website that sells trading cards, and I've been mildly crushing on a coworker for awhile now.

"He starts to berate me again and follow me throughout the house and outside. When we were outside his tune changed and tried to make it seem as if I was being crazy for no reason.

Did I say what I needed to nicely? I didn't. What he was dishing to me, I gave it back to him. He wanted me to stop talking and when I refused to not be heard after he insulted me, he started choking me several times in front of his mother, sister, 8 year old nephew, and my 7 month old infant son.","He starts to berate me again and follow me throughout the house and outside.

For me, it's been on the rare occasion I feel a special connection with a girl so I have little experience with relationships/dating. Ive only be in a relationship once in the past 3 years and it's kind of taken its toll on me. It's nothing wrong with me (I think), I consider myself an all around good person. It just hurts me on the days when I need a hug or someone to talk too.Any advice on how to feel better?(I'm not sure if this is the best place to post, let me know if there is a better place)","I've had a hard time recently because my crush wasn't interested in me.

"Hey, 18 F here. I have pretty bad anxiety and i finally got the courage to schedule my driver's test a few weeks ago. I studied my heart out, took 11 pages of notes on the driver's manual, and i thought i was ready. But I missed a stop sign and that's an automatic failure. I never even saw the damn thing because there was a tree branch in the way, and ended up missing a second one because I sort of went into a panicked state and shut down. When I parked and the lady told me a failed, i started bawling and I ended up crying all the way home and for a few hours after that. My dad (bless his heart) ended up having to call me out of work because when the time came around I was still crying and refused to get out of bed. Having a license is a really big thing for me because it's the next step in becoming completely independent and the bridge toward being able to finally quit my shitty job, move out, and get away from my kind of abusive mom.","Hey, 18 F here.

"Going through a tough time in my life. 37F. My husband of 2 years walked out on me a month ago and filed for divorce. No cheating or major issues, just differences in values. I don't want the divorce. Other than this 2 year marriage, I have been single most of my adult life.My parents are both gone. I have a stepmother, but she and I have a very strained relationship and she is very critical of me and expresses her disapproval of how I do things all the time.  My father was my best friend. However, she's said a few things to me about how my father viewed me as having ""issues"".I have one brother, but we are not close. I do not have children.I have to wonder if there is something wrong with me. I feel I am the nicest person and quite easy to get along with. I have 4 excellent friends who are helping me hold everything together.I feel like I don't have anyone and I like I don't have any family. I have cried and hurt so much over my husband leaving that now I just don't care anymore. The hurts are piling on to where I just feel  indifferent.","Going through a tough time in my life. 37F.

And he never does the precalc hw but he does great every test), hes humble (when I told him I got a hundred on my English midterm, he seemed genuinely happy even thought hes in much higher level classes than me), and hes fairly attractive.Ugh, hes probably the most mischievous little person around his friends and then hes nice- almost shy- with people that arent his friends.

"So when quarantine began, I decided to get healthy. Ive been using a TRX suspension trainer since April and improved my diet. I was working out for about an hour, four days a week and cut back in carbs and processed sugars. My pants dont fit me and I needed to buy new clothes.Fast forward... I cranked it up to 5 days a week and was even more restrictive with dieting. That lasted for two weeks before my body said F U and I had to take last week off. Then I just ate like half a pizza and some cake lol.I think I need to stick to four days a week with a healthy, but less restrictive diet. By doing this, I feel like Im failing to make progress and I need to hear this is not a failure; its a strategy for maintaining a sustainable routine. Right?

"I had to pull over in a parking lot because it was too dangerous to continue to drive. At the time, my car did not have AC and I had my son in the backseat taking him to daycare. I call my partner to inform him that I needed his help because my car was disabled. He asked me to drop a pin at my location and I did but it gave the incorrect address, so I gave him the actual address of where I was. Instead of coming to get me, he started to rant about not wanting to be on the road searching for me. I get irritated and curse at him and from then on he argued me to death about he is doing me a favor and that I shouldn't be talking to people in a certain way when I need something. He continued to refuse to come and get me and instructed me to find someone else to pick me up. When I did, he got upset that I even asked him and proceeded to argue with me for the rest of the day. During the arguments he stated that he wish he never met me and had a baby with me and stated that he wished his son was dead.","I had to pull over in a parking lot because it was too dangerous to continue to drive.

Oh and not being able to see 2 of my friends wasn't enough I got pulled into the counselors office and told that I will be repeating earth science and that I will be taking a course over the summer.

"Hi Reddit! I could use some encouragement. My living situation is really weird right now. Three days/nights a week, I live in a small city for my master's program. During that time,  I live in a house with this random older woman (she's nice, but still random) and a roommate. It's comfortable enough, but def not my home and I always feel like a stranger/guest. The other three nights a week, I live with my fiance four hours north in an apartment that we don't love in a town we both hate (it's super rural, we miss our families & friends in another state, etc). So, half the week I'm at school in a weird living situation, and the other half I'm with my fiance in a weird living situation. So, my car is kind of my home. I keep all my stuff in my car all the time (so yes, it's a mess). This arrangement will only last until Christmas break, so I have like 10 more weeks to go like this. This whole thing was my decision and done by my own hand, so I really have no right to complain, but it is still confusing and difficult. To make it all even more weird, one of my professors also hired me to house/dog sit a few nights a week, so I'll also be staying in a third house sometimes coming up. Anyone else ever lived out of their car, kinda? Please share any encouraging thoughts or ideas with me to get through this odd phase of my life!!! ","Hi Reddit! I could use some encouragement.

"First time poster, could really use a pick me up.Heres the full story. Wall of text incoming, but theres a tldr at the end. Out of college I got hired to do social media for a political lobbyist group. I won't say which one because I don't want to start anything, that's not what this is about. The point is it paid well enough. At age 22 I was making 36k a year. But I was miserable. The morals were questionable, the workload was soul crushing, and the hours were unappreciated. Not to mention my bosses were all crazy homophobic.But I found my passion in fitness while I was there. No matter how bad my day at work was I could go to the gym and lift it out, get it out of my system, feel good and accomplished about something.So after a year and a half at that job, I got my personal training certification.

"Just need a little encouragement. A man threatened suicide when I told him I no longer wanted to date. I helped him get help and when I thought the situation deescalated, I left. He since has sent numerous texts and emails. Finally, he sent a 4-page letter to my house claiming that I caused all of the anxiety, depression, and desire to end it all. I filed a PFA (protection from abuse) against him. He is an abuser and its going to take a lot to be in the same room as him tomorrow - and to listen to him make up his version of reality, and to fight the protection I am seeking.I am hoping against hope that the judge believes me and is willing to grant this order to give me some peace of mind.","Just need a little encouragement.

"Hello, it's been a long-time secret hobby of mine to record myself playing instruments for fun, but i never had the guts to share my small projects with anyone close to me. Not a single soul. The thought itself is nerve-wracking for me.Early this year, I created a YT channel where I can start first by making covers before posting my own-----except that I am still too nervous to share it with others. There are a few views but from strangers, so it makes me less anxious that people do not know it is me. Just now, I did try sharing it with a few friends, who are still yet to respond. In the meantime, it's making my stomach churn.Generally, I think I am just scared of disappointing them.I know I need to let others hear my outputs because I need feedback to improve and grow. How do you think I should go about this?I hope it's okay to ask on here. :(Thank you in advance!EDIT: Thank you so much for the quick response :( This means a lot to me!EDIT: After reading your replies, I see that a link to the channel is requested.

"A little background. I'm 36, male, 290lbs, and found out that I'm diabetic about a year and a half ago.  I'm still overweight and trying the Atkins diet now.  I have been recording my walks to track them to see if I'm improving on my time. Today I pushed myself a little bit harder and tracked a 14 minute and 17 seconds mile. So far that's my fastest mile pace. I was very proud of this achievement because it's been awhile since I've gotten under 15 minutes. Not really looking for any type of advice to make it better just a little bit of encouragement that I didn't receive when I got home. Thanks.","A little background.

"I have always struggled with anxiety and depression, and the current state of the world has compounded it a thousand times over. Between street violence to cities burning to COVID and political corruption on all sides, I feel like the only future for America is a bleak one.

"Today was a great day. I spent the day at Chuck E. Cheese's with my mother, little brother, and my 3 nieces. Bro and I racked up 5,000+ tickets for the girls to spend on prizes. Came home and finished up NaNoWriMo, getting in all 50k words a day early, even though this month was rife with days so full of depression I wanted to just give up on it entirely and binge watch tv or play video games instead.So actually feeling a little bit more productive than usual. Then I get an email from my boss. So around November 14th, he tells me I need to ""pause"" work until December 5th due to some cash flow issues that he needs to straighten out. I'm not happy with this but I can't do anything about it because I work remotely from home as a contract employee. But today's email tells me that all of my accounts are being deactivated to ""save money"" and that he hopes the team can get up and functional again in January and he hopes I'll be part of the team then.So I'm essentially now unemployed for all of December which means Christmas is going to suck even more than usual, and I'm probably going to spend the next couple of weeks struggling with the heavier bouts of depression and anxiety again.I've been applying for jobs both remote and local for two months now and I haven't gotten anything, no bites at all. It's just really discouraging and I am losing all of my confidence, and maybe I thought reddit would have nice things to say to help cheer me up a little. Maybe this is the right subreddit for that.","Today was a great day. I spent the day at Chuck E. Cheese's with my mother, little brother, and my 3 nieces.

"I'm 31. I was diagnosed this Tuesday with prediabetes and high cholesterol. They put me on statins. I wasn't surprised. I'm 360lbs and 5'5.I have PCOS and my hormones have always been awful. I don't have periods, never did even when I was smaller. I can probably grow a mustache and beard. The upkeep is frustrating. I have always felt worthless. I was getting gal bladder attacks regularly for 3 years but I thought I was faking it for sympathy. I spent several months trying to get the pain diagnosed. My job fired me for absences, even though I scheduled them and got written permission. Temp manufacturing work. 1 year and a half. Didn't matter. 1 week later I was hospitalized. Almost died. Several surgeries to remove my gallbladder and several stones. When I got home I should've done physical therapy. I was always active. I put on weight. 100 lbs. I tried to do call centers. Found out that years of emotional abuse had made it so I just sob when customers yell at me.","I'm 31. I was diagnosed this Tuesday with prediabetes and high cholesterol. They put me on statins.

"And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up, because there had been no rain in the land.
1 Kings 17:7 KJV
God never leaves us stranded, forsaken, or abandoned. If the brook dries up, it's because He has a jar of oil waiting for us. When a disappointment strikes us, we must trust Him for the next move. When a dream crashes around us, look for God's direction and a new challenge. There is always a next step with God; and there are always new blessings - grace upon grace - to claim from His guiding hand. What a great God we have. Have a blessed day.   :)","And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up, because there had been no rain in the land.

There is always a next step with God; and there are always new blessings - grace upon grace - to claim from His guiding hand. What a great God we have. Have a blessed day.   :)"
"I totally lost my entire cool. He never admitted any wrong doing even after I told him what I saw with my own eyes and claimed I got what I deserved because I went through his phone. He only admitted to entertaining the females after I told him that it was over.&amp;#x200B;Incident 7We traveled to Niagra Falls for a quick getaway date hour. Everything is going nicely until we start taking pictures of each other. I see him take a picture of both of us and post on SnapChat. I take a picture of him and post on SnapChat as well. Two minutes later he asks me if I put his picture on Snap. I say yes, and proceed to show him and his picture failed. I'm reloading the picture back to the app and he freaks out accusing me of lying and hiding him from social media.","I totally lost my entire cool.

"Right now Im sitting in my dark and empty house and I dont know if I can do this thing called life. Ive been battling this demon for years now. No one knows whats really going on with me.

I know I need to talk this out with a professional, but I cant afford that or the insurance to cover it. Its cruel how the world keeps on going after your own world lies in ashes at your feet. Tbh, I feel empty inside. I have for quite a while now. Thats not really the truth though. I do feel something. Fear. Im afraid of losing those I care about. Im afraid that Im not good enough. Even now, Im afraid that youre thinking Im being melodramatic when all Im really doing is trying to describe whats going on in my head. I know Im self destructive and I dont care. That makes me afraid of the person behind the mask I put on every day to face the world.I want someone to care.

"I just finished packing my car by myself! I know its just a small part of moving but I dont know where else to go for encouragement with the little stuff. Both of my parents are out and about so I had to pack by myself, but it was nicer than expected. My (soon to be) roommate is already on the way and my boyfriend is on vacation without cell service, so I dont really have anyone to talk to. I hope everyone is having a great day :)","I just finished packing my car by myself! I know its just a small part of moving but I dont know where else to go for encouragement with the little stuff.

"I'm 19, I weigh 235 lb I used to be 250 at the beginning of the year, but it's really hard to keep exercising. Just today I was at the gym not 10 minutes ago and a couple of super skinny super hot girls just snickered at me. Part of it's probably because I'm paranoid but I feel like they were saying look at the fat girl trying to be like us Jesus Christ she doesn't f****** belong here. And so I ran home. I don't know if I can keep going to the gym and having those negative experiences. I'm just to anxiety-ridden and depressed to not go to the gym but at the same time when it's making those symptoms worse...

"He goes into a rage and starts calling me out of my name and berating me once again. He's telling me I'm trash, that's why I don't have a ring on my finger, all of my relationships in the future will result in men passing me around because I'm a grimy person. I fall for this trap and lose my shit and get into a verbal altercation with him. What made me really blow a gasket is when he tells me that he gave me another chance and I haven't changed my behavior. I hang up on him. I decided to call him later in the day and noticed my number was blocked. This isn't the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth time he's done this either. I get upset again, so I call his mother and tell her whats going on and state that I feel my son should not be going out of town with him because my partner has a habit of not answering phone calls because he's upset with me and I don't want my son out of town and I have no way of contacting any one to see how he's doing while he's away from me.","He goes into a rage and starts calling me out of my name and berating me once again.

"And just when the company was supposed to call me for joining, Covid happened. Hope diminished, Loan EMI still going on which my father pays, lost out on peace. Its then I began to ponder on my identity and what I relied on. And I found the answer in a verse from bible, Romans 8:28~ and we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose The responsibility I have is to shift my identity and put it in God, because God is permanent. When I put my identity , of who I am in something permanent thats when there is no fear of losing peace, thats when I have nothing to be anxious of. Doesnt it answer our fundamental question. We lose so much of our lives in giving and focusing on temporary needs and dont realise the grave danger of losing out on hope. I found the answer in this Covid 19 situation and somehow Im grateful that I realised it. Im regaining my peace during the madness around me and I want to leave you with this exhortation to shift your identity to Jesus.

"We sat there talking about the possibilities for an hour straight.I got overwhelmed and needed to cool off in their bathroom.

I was this underaccomplished loser that barely achieved anything noteworthy in my life, always felt like a disappointment to my family, and here I had just stumbled across something that could change the world. I didnt deserve this, I hadnt worked for it at all, it was literally something I thought of while I was laying in bed after hitting the snooze button.That was the exact moment my psychotic break triggered. I became convinced that none of this was real. All an elaborate farce. My personal version of hell. I screamed and smashed my head against the mirror repeatedly.

"Blood everywhere. Its left a couple scars. Im lucky Im not blind.I dont want to tell you the whole story it would take a long time to recount all the details and a lot of it was just madness. I feel compelled to mention that I was begging my friends to get a gun and shoot me. I grabbed my friend by the hair and said terrible things to him (were no longer friends). The police came, and I was delirious but not combative, since I had collapsed. During the ambulance ride and for several hours afterwards I was hearing voices. My legs and arms were cuffed to a bed for the entire night. They position you in a certain uncomfortable position so you cant reach your hands close enough together to grab/use anything. I was so convinced that this was Hell, that I used my teeth to pull a cord coming from a nearby monitor and wrapped it around my neck to try to strangle myself.My sense of time became massively warped. It felt like I was in that hospital for 300 years. I eventually calmed down enough that they actually approved to release me.","Blood everywhere. Its left a couple scars.

The police came, and I was delirious but not combative, since I had collapsed. During the ambulance ride and for several hours afterwards I was hearing voices. My legs and arms were cuffed to a bed for the entire night. They position you in a certain uncomfortable position so you cant reach your hands close enough together to grab/use anything. I was so convinced that this was Hell, that I used my teeth to pull a cord coming from a nearby monitor and wrapped it around my neck to try to strangle myself.My sense of time became massively warped. It felt like I was in that hospital for 300 years. I eventually calmed down enough that they actually approved to release me."
"Hi all!Im (40F) just looking for people to tell me its going to be ok. I suffer from anxiety disorder which means I overthink trying to figure out or solve my problems.    I get a physical reaction in my body when my anxiety rises up.    My heart races but also feels like it drops into my stomach.  My stomach starts twisting and flipping and getting jittery.  My face becomes flushed and I also feel light headed.Internally Im freaking out but tend to express it through irritation and anger.    And I know it is all fear based and fight or flight nervous system reaction.    I need to move at the end of the month and no matter how much I try to work the math, it looks like Im not going to have enough money to get it done.    Something has to give, meaning I might be able to pay rent and moving expenses but I might not be able to pay the electric bill or buy groceries for my kids.    I dont have any friends or family I can turn to for help. I know these things have a way of working themselves out but it still fucking terrifies me.    Im trying to think of ways I can earn extra money outside of my full time minimum wage job.    Some encouragement is needed and I hope this is the right forum for this. Thanks for any uplifting advice or anything really.    I dont have a lot of people in my life to tell my problems to, so here I am.","Hi all!Im (40F) just looking for people to tell me its going to be ok.

"Hey everyone,I am feeling really overwhelmed, and I wasn't sure where else to turn. My long-term boyfriend left me a few days ago completely unexpectedly, the day before Thanksgiving. We share a house, a dog and two cats. I wouldn't have committed to all of those things if I didn't think he was in it for the long haul. We just renewed our least last month.I have finals for grad school this weekend and next. It's a really hard program that I'm struggling with right now. I need to get an A on one of my finals or I will get kicked out (the program requires above an 85 in all classes and I did really poorly on the midterm).I haven't had time to study. I am so stressed. I can't afford the house on my own, so I have been scrambling for an apartment. I think I found one that I can move to next Monday. I am taking my dog and one of our cats. I feel horrible for them. Do you think they know and are sad?I started a new job (with my same company, but a lot more responsibilities) two weeks ago. I just started a new medication (Zoloft) last week before the breakup happened. There is so much happening and I don't know what emotions are caused by the breakup...or the medicine...or school or the job.I know it will get better...but how can I be ok enough now to focus on school and work? I feel so sad and scared and I'm just really struggling, but I don't want to give up now. I'm sorry that I'm complaining so much. I know I am very fortunate in many ways. I wish I could just focus on that and let go of all of the pain I am feeling.Thank you.","Hey everyone,I am feeling really overwhelmed, and I wasn't sure where else to turn.

"These past 4 days have been awful and I don't know what to do anymore. It all started on Thursday ( some context I'm 16) I got a call during school lunchtime that my best friend Jay(18) had been arrested for assault, he had beat his sister's  abusive boyfriend half to death so I'll probably never see him again but then an hour later I hear from my good friend John that my friend Mike(15) will be moving out of state because he got his girlfriend pregnant. Oh and not being able to see 2 of my friends wasn't enough I got pulled into the counselors office and told that I will be repeating earth science and that I will be taking a course over the summer. And on top of that my mom kicks me out of the house for 4 hours and I don't have a car so I get to bike in a rainstorm and when I'm finally allowed back in she tells me that I need to fuck off and stop being bad at school. It feels like my life is over and that I'm falling under and that I'm trapped if you have anything to say I'm all ears","These past 4 days have been awful and I don't know what to do anymore.

"I'm depressed and bored. I'm unable or too lazy to do anything against it. I usually watch YouTube and Netflix all day even though I can't accomplish anything else. I have a lot of guys in my class that I'm pretty cool with but I don't really do anything with them besides going to school with them. I really can't make myself meet anyone because I don't really find an occasion to do so. One guys always busy because he worries a lot about his health and grades, I only seem to do anything with another friend when I wanna smoke with him and his girlfriend is really annoying and doesn't seem to like me. It feels really odd to go in a close friend circle as a guy who just wants social interactions and doesn't think he's special at all. Some other friends are playing video games together and talk with TeamSpeak but they only play games I don't really like and my parents are pretty strict about video games. I only seem to reduce my sadness by eating and sometimes doing some sport and school is like a blessing because I can communicate without planning something out that might just not happen again. I'm typing this text because it might help me feel better by finally telling someone about it. I'm sorry for my English because I'm not a native speaker and I'm just writing without really thinking a lot.","I'm depressed and bored. I'm unable or too lazy to do anything against it.

"A little over a month ago I was tossed out of my apartment by my now ex-girlfriend.  I was sleeping on my friends couch for a week, and then my job asked me if I wanted to travel to another location temporarily.  Originally it was supposed to be 30 days, but I signed another 90 day commitment so my total time out will be 120 days.  It has just sunk in on me that I'm effectively homeless, living out of a hotel room with nowhere to go.  Fortunately my job put me in the hotel and are paying for it.  I just need someone to give me words of encouragement.","A little over a month ago I was tossed out of my apartment by my now ex-girlfriend.

"Ive been on a downward spiralMy fianc and I have moved in together at the start of 2020, which either highlighted or exposed some major dependency issues that she has. On top of that, her mental health has been beyond terrible for herwhich is likely a huge driving force for the dependencyand Ive gotten Caregivers Fatigue 3 or 4 times already. I desperately want to communicate this issue but she can already read it off of me (been together for a long time) which is making her mental health worse at times, and I think if we were to outright have that conversation it would cause her mental health to be even worse. She also gets upset that it seems like I view her as helpless and unable to function without me, and admittedly I do because shes so extremely needyI hate myself physically. Literally from my head to my toes: I cant find a good haircut and the barber that I helped out with that couldnt be consistent, then COVID hit and Im out a barber &amp; reference point for my hair. Im in too low of a funk to consistently care about maintaining my beard which is as frustrating as daily care would be. Ive been gaining fat all of 2020 which not only do I want to lose weight but Im also a nutrition major so thats not a good look.","Ive been on a downward spiralMy fianc and I have moved in together at the start of 2020, which either highlighted or exposed some major dependency issues that she has.

"I have a tough time connecting with my dad (mom died 18 months ago).  I am on the fence about whether my husband and I should really be together.  Sometimes I would rather be by myself and my thoughts than other people.  Sometimes my internal monologue is just really negative.  Sometimes it just seems like too much to call a friend.  Problem is, I have a son and I know I need to open up and show him how a person can connect.  I don't really know where I need to go but I wish the guys from Queer eye could come and just fix my life in a week.  I guess I just have to do that for myself.  I think I need to force myself to go out and talk to other people and do things to bring me in to connection with the world.  I just feel like hiding under a blanket for the rest of my life.  I of course can't do that.  Wish I could be different as I constantly don't like myself.  Not really sure what I'm asking.","I have a tough time connecting with my dad (mom died 18 months ago).

"So...Today I was planning on giving myself a pizza birthday with anyone who wanted to join on my campus. I only have two friends. I got a check for $100 yesterday that I cashed and I have been looking forward to this all week. Even after my birthday that happened this past Wednesday. I had some bills to pay like hulu and neflix which I didn't mind. But i made sure that I was saving enough to I could buy the stuff. I got on the bus. Got some drinks for myself and I got two bracelets from hot topic too but what I didn't realize was that most of my billing stuff happened today. So I went from $60 to $8 cause I didn't know my netflix bill and hulu bill happened today. So after I bought drinks and two cool bracelets for myself, I didn't have enough money to buy my pizzas. I was at target and I had put two digornio's stuffed cheese pizzas in my cart and I was trying to check my bank finances cause I always get paranoid that money is going to disappear. But I had $40 after I bought my bracelets.","So...Today I was planning on giving myself a pizza birthday with anyone who wanted to join on my campus. I only have two friends.

"Im 7 months postpartum and having some trouble getting over PPD. Lots of crying lately and being overly sensitive to little things that wouldnt typically bother me. I guess just feeling pretty insecure personally. Also not feeling like myself- I used to do a lot alone like go to the mall, the movies, out to eat. I used to be very tidy and organized. I used to read and crochet. I do almost nothing that I did before I became a mom and now its like everything is about my son and if its not then I feel like a bad mom. Anyways, I just reached out to a girlfriend of mine and asked if she wouldnt mind going out for dinner so I could start trying to get out of the house. Would love some encouragement that this is a good step in the right direction because my heart is actually beating fast from embarrassment.","Im 7 months postpartum and having some trouble getting over PPD.

"Hi, Im a 14 year old girl who started ballet a few months ago, 14 is VERY late to start ballet especially for a girl. I really want to make ballet a career in the future but today I feel so discouraged. My teacher basically tells us every class well never make it any farther than weve gotten already and tells us about how future professionals our age are already signed with companies, that if were not en pointe by 13 well go nowhere. Im basically having a breakdown right now after class and honestly feel like I should just quit even though I want nothing more in life then to dance. If any of you can give me any sort of encouragement or advice at all I would appreciate it so much.

"Cooking, cleaning, planning meals, doing odd jobs for money. Ive lost everything it feels like but our room mate is covering us for now. I got us food stamps and medicaid and Im trying to get help, hence the diagnosis. Please don't harass me about being on snap, I don't want to be on it and they only give me 25$ a week. Have you ever tried to feed 2 adults on that amount? It's ramen and bread and my weight just stays the same. I lost weight on keto a few years ago. 50 lbs. It alleviated my pcos symptoms. I was so happy. But I can't afford it now. I keep trying. I know that I need to suck it up and suffer through. I know that I should eat eggs for every meal and canned tuna and lose the weight by sheer determination. I know that the pain in my hips and ankles is nothing and I should just walk through it. I know I should take a job and just grind it out every day. But when I think about the pain of that, I feel like giving up and dying. I just don't think that I can do it, or this anymore. I have plans to see a therapist. I have to ramp up to it. I make a bunch of calls and then I am burnt out and have to ramp up to it again. And yes, I know.

"Just need a little encouragement. A man threatened suicide when I told him I no longer wanted to date. I helped him get help and when I thought the situation deescalated, I left. He since has sent numerous texts and emails. Finally (much, much later when I thought this was over) he sent a 4-page letter to my house claiming that I caused all of the anxiety, depression, and desire to end it all. I filed a PFA (protection from abuse) against him. He is an abuser and its going to take a lot to be in the same room as him tomorrow - and to listen to him make up his version of reality, and to fight the protection I am seeking.I am hoping against hope that the judge believes me and is willing to grant this order to give me some peace of mind.UPDATE: abuser tried to outright lie and say I kept coming to his building so HE now wanted an order against ME. My incredible lawyer was not having any of that - and I was granted the order. Thank you everyone for your encouragement. I am so relieved","Just need a little encouragement.

"It turns out, the only thing  I'm allowed to say is that the funds are not available (in the account). So I had just revealed private information.I called a coworker over to help me figure out what was going on and when the call ended he gave me this 'I can't believe you did that/You were not supposed to do that' face and said that I shouldn't have revealed the account balance and that all I was supposed to do was verify whether or not funds were available.

"I get up to flee, slip and hit my face on the ground. I try to go and get my son he blocks me from doing so. I end up getting my son and running out of the apartment. I walk up the sidewalk a little bit to calm down and when I return to my car he is blocking my driver side door. I ask him to move several times and he refuses. I tell him if he didn't move I was going to call the cops. He snatches my phone and tells me that I'm not. It was evident that he was not going to allow me to leave.","I get up to flee, slip and hit my face on the ground. I try to go and get my son he blocks me from doing so.

"For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling.  I will walk before the Lord in the land of the living.Psalms 116:8-9 KJVThe psalmist often had to listen to the echo of their own prayers as they cried out to God from a place of isolation. Even if others are around, we can feel lonely if we forget that God is always there. We don't know who wrote Psalm 116, or in what circumstances, but the situation was dire (Seems hopeless). In verse Three he said the pain of death surrounded him and he found trouble and sorrow. During his isolation and fear, he called out to God, and beg God to deliver his soul (verse 4). But in verse 5 we find Gracious is the LORD, and righteous and merciful.No trouble is greater than God's power. Loneliness is a fiction since God is always with us. Call upon Him today and He will hear you, and draw near to you. Have a blessed day.   :)","For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling.

"I grew up in a home where the only point of existing as a girl was to get married, be a good wife and have kids. When I failed to get married in my 20s, and now am in my almost mid 30s, I am considered a failure by my religious family. It doesnt matter that Ive moved alone, found a job to support myself, had to learn absolutely everything on my own.  My mom doesnt care and wonders why I wont just settle for a guy who will make money. That guy has never come along and I didnt have the option of being homeless and jobless.Yesterday I finally researched in detail about ux (user interaction) design. I finally learned about the process and how I could start this path.For the first time this year I have felt hopeful. Its been such a bad year, so many horrible things happened. I had a legit near death experience a few months ago and had to deal with legal research and consequences of that.For the first time I feel hopeful even though Im alone and have no one to be happy for me.","I grew up in a home where the only point of existing as a girl was to get married, be a good wife and have kids.

"I got back from a not so great month long  Army training where the logistics fell through and it was miserable. Not going into many details on that but it was a nightmare for all of us except our company kicked-ass at the mission and my soldiers are all getting awards. I get back and imidiately have to start moving to my new apartment. I have two days to move. Day two of being back my very old car then gets a huge hole in the oil pan and the engine is deprived of oil for too long and needs to be scrapped due to critical damage to the engine. The car had a computer issue which would set off four signals: oil light, 'BRAKE' light; 'ABS' light; RPMs drop to zero. Ignored the computer issue on the basis that it was too expensive to get replaced for an old 98' car I only needed to run for anouther nine months. I could have prevented the oil issue, had I fixed it. I also don't necessarily need a car where I live so things will be fine. So fast forward to 1AM last night. I'm about to go to bed after working about 12 hours on a work project that's due on Friday. I realize that because I was moving, and to my own stupidity, I left my birth certificate and SSN card in the back pocket of the driver's seat. That car is now scrapped. So I immediately started figuring out how to order a new birth certificate and SSN. Ordered the birth certificate, and will order the SSN card today. Stay up til 430 AM duper stressed and I still am.I know things will turn up, I'm keeping positive.

"A lot of people have told me that most people fail their first time, but it really doesn't make me feel better about it. The lady testing me tried to get me to reschedule for Monday (which has already passed) but i wanted to see my school councilor about it first. Unfortunately, this week is the dreaded standardized testing week so I don't think I'm gonna be able to see her, and I honestly don't think I can handle my job any longer. I'm really stuck between a rock and a hard place here. On one hand: i really need to take that next step forward towards the plan I have going, but I also feel so so embarassed and i don't want to see that lady again because she had to see me cry. I'd go to a different driving school but I'd have to pay more at a new place than I'd have to for a retake. My only real choice here is to stand up and do it.Can anyone please give me the encouragement to call back and try again next week? I really need it.","A lot of people have told me that most people fail their first time, but it really doesn't make me feel better about it.

"I just didn't want to keep being diagnosed and fighting for disability and stuff over and over, I was tired of it after 15 years of doing it. All those 15 years I never worked (because if you work or volunteer at all your automatically disqualified for any disability or help at all.) So, I didn't work or volunteer for anything those 15 years and now those years are gone and I can't get them back. Now I'm back living in Toronto Ontario Canada and I'm 32 years old. I still haven't graduated high school, never been to a college or a university, I have no training in anything, and I have no work experience. When applying for jobs those that are hiring don't care at all about my history they just see it as some big sob story or that I'm just lazy and didn't try hard enough. I'm going to try to get on Ontario Works (which is government aid) when my health card comes in the mail (have to have that to apply for Ontario Works, I don't know why but that's one of their rules.) So, I'll do that and I'll see what I can do about applying for work.","I just didn't want to keep being diagnosed and fighting for disability and stuff over and over, I was tired of it after 15 years of doing it.

"Hey guys. So Ive been struggling a lot with self-esteem when it comes to my looks. Ive had the same haircut since like 4th grade  (10th grade now) and get teased about it. About a month ago I tried something new, only to be made fun of for that. I ended up reverting back to my old hairstyle. Today i got a haircut (just shortened my hair, didnt change the style) and, once again I was made fun of, even by an adult coworker. I have acne pretty bad, and regardless of what I try its just inexorable. My ears stick out super far, and the young kids I work with say I look like an elf. I have major bags under my eyes due to a type of insomnia, and my face is unsymmetrical when I examine it.At this point its just a struggle to deal with all these things. Im fairly popular but still face social anxiety, especially when talking to girls, due to my low opinion of my looks. I could really use some encouragement. Any and all is welcome. Thanks guys :)","Hey guys. So Ive been struggling a lot with self-esteem when it comes to my looks. Ive had the same haircut since like 4th grade  (10th grade now) and get teased about it.

I visit every year for Xmas, but this time it got sadder to go back to work after the holidays. I realised that I'd usually keep my head down at work for a whole year, and it started to feel sad and pointless. When I met up with a close friend while I was home, we talked about what really makes you feel happy, and singing is something that came up for as I felt it was like an outlet. The issue is that I feel like I can never compare, so I never tried.For a long time I knew and felt that my voice isn't great, and especially not the kind that would make your head turn and go - whoa that person can sing!I never realise how it really stopped me from doing a lot of things - like trying at all. Or practising, because I completely ruled myself out.I never uploaded Youtube videos cause I always thought that I just wouldn't compare, so don't try.","Ok so I'm pretty freaked out right now.

"Hi everyone,I'm feeling sad and could really use some encouragement. I've been on and off slightly sick for weeks, just body aches and fatigue that lasts only a day. Well, a few days ago I had that again, along with a minor fever, but this time the symptoms have lasted several days. It is totally bearable, but I am just feeling really emotional and tired of being sick. Today my fever is a little worse, and on top of that, I'm in grad school and my current class has us reading several readings a day plus long blog posts. I'm tired of having to read all day, write a long blog post, and being sick on top of that. I just want to lay in bed all day and relax, nap, and cry a little. I apologize if this post is too ""complain-y"" and I know there are much more important things in the world than me being tired of being sick. I am so thankful that I can do school from home and not have to go out for work, especially with the pandemic going on. I am also thankful that my symptoms are not as bad as many people right now, but I am also really scared that this might lowkey be covid and the symptoms will ramp up.

Im not the dumbest (my precalc grade would argue otherwise) and Ill admit Im in honor classes and Ive got a poem published in a book but thats about it. I try to stay fit too so its not like, health wise, were super different. I dont think it could ever work out anyways and I dont think his friends would approve of him dating me and I also think that  he would probably go chase the pretty girls that are also in the AP classes and equally as smart as him.

"Hey everyone, hope you're doing well in these trying times.I'm just really upset because I have a 58 in my calc midterm. I'm trying to go to university and I can't help but feel really discouraged at how poorly I'm doing. I spent my whole life grinding academically for this moment and I'm choking really hard. Would really appreciate it if someone could believe in me, because I'm spiralling and I'm so anxious all the time about not being able to go to an accredited program. Thanks for your time :)","Hey everyone, hope you're doing well in these trying times.I'm just really upset because I have a 58 in my calc midterm.

"Which in my eyes was a good thing because a lot of people apply and most dont get interviews. Well if I could cut the curve and gone to interviews then I beat more than the people and had a higher chance. However I ultimately didnt get accepted. So I decided it was time to not necessarily stop my dreams of medical school, but rather but it on pause and do something else for a bit and if the cards play out, reapply to medical school later down the road. Focusing and narrowing down to what I liked to do best, I found myself pursuing nursing. I looked at a lot of nursing programs in my home state of Alabama, and found that most of them require at least a 3.0 for a BSN program but if I wanted to do a ADN program it ranged from a minimum gpa of 2.0-2.8ish. My mindset is that I wasted a lot of time focusing on trying to get into medical school that I really needed to become serious and not waste anymore time. I want to start a program in the spring of 2021. Most application deadlines are October 6.","Which in my eyes was a good thing because a lot of people apply and most dont get interviews.

"Hey all. This is kind of a ridiculous thing to feel but alas here goes. I'm really disheartened by my love life right now- every time I start to wind up pushing the boundaries of ""just friends"", when it's usually not even initiated by me at all, it falls apart when the guy ""isnt ready"" or (usually this is the case) afraid or something. It makes me feel like shit, that they dont especially care and that they are just too chickenshit to tell me they arent into me like that Idk it's happening yet again where he initiated everything at first and then it flipped, where i feel like I'm the one that cares more and it's annoying. So many of my female friends are in serious relationships/getting married and I havent dated anybody since high school. I literally havent had a single boyfriend in college. Everyone I know seems to have at least had a solid dating life? I'm just the perpetually single friend and I dont want to be anymore.","Hey all.

"I have a part-time retail job which admittedly I love, mostly because of an awesome manager. But it's not enough to live on, so I'm planning to get some electrician training. There's always a market for that, they're unionized, and I love working with my hands. So far, so good. I've located a technical college that:\- is less than half an hour from my house (\*super convenient\*)\- has a six-month certificate program (\*not so short that it feels incomplete, not so long that I get frustrated\*)\- offers job placement assistance after graduation (\*SCORE!\*)\- classes start at 7:45 AM (\*record scratch sound effect...\*)Oh dear. There's a reason I work the evening shift. I know this is a petty thing to get hung up on in the face of such an otherwise-perfect opportunity, but it's been a VERY long time since I've been required to get up early on a regular basis. And now I'm on medication with a side effect of insomnia. My current situation is unsustainable, and these early classes will allow me to stick with my usual evening shift; but I have a long history of being easily discouraged and can already feel myself backpedaling. I need someone to talk me out of talking myself out of this.","I have a part-time retail job which admittedly I love, mostly because of an awesome manager.

I've put a post onr/randomactsofkindnessrequesting people to send a card/postcard/letter with uplifting/heartwarming words to my boyfriend (in Vancouver) who's PTSDs and depression.Here's the content I've written in that post:We've been together for three years. He's now living in Vancouver and has been waiting for an available therapist/counselor/psychologist to help him since February (very likely that he's been too apathetic to actively seek professional help or to do follow up check work for seeing how the waiting list is going from time to time). He's broke, and his physical health isn't good. He also wears hearing aids.Last year in October he experienced something really awful. The torture was ""finished"" in November. He then had to go back to Canada to look for some professional help. Until that time he told me he had a PTSD happened in his childhood. I finally realized why sometimes he acted like this and that, and why he's had suicidal ideation.Side story: He's had a marriage and got divorced. He met me five years after the divorce.I've anxiety disorder, depression, OCDs (cough, clear throat and spit), choking anxiety and BMI is below 15. I was diagnosed with these mental health issues in May last year.","Hi all. Thank you for taking your time to read this thread.

"I've been unemployed since January, basically fired from a great job I had for a few months. I've applied to jobs online and went to a temp agency but nothing has resulted in work. i don't have health insurance and my savings are being depleted. I have kept my unemployment hush hush, but I've heard that talking to people in your network can help you land a job. I've created a list of 6 ppl I can reach out to to talk about finding employment and support in my future endeavors (going to grad school). I am full of anxiety that what I say won't make sense, no one will want to help me, my lack of follow through will jeopardize things, if I get a job through this I'll fuck that up too, etc. Asking for help feels like an excruciating slow death. Sometimes I think it'd be easier just to kill myself. Normally, I'd rather have my teeth pulled than ask for help and be vulnerable, but if I don't do anything I'll have to move back in with my parents (I'm not sure I can survive that and it wouldn't be easy to do b/c of their own issues). But there's also the very real fear that I do all this and still get no work (but then I'd just look for some minimum wage gigs, but even those have not been easy to get and I have loans to pay). I'm thinking about reaching out to everyone on the list in a blaze of motivation.

"Today was a great day. I spent the day at Chuck E. Cheese's with my mother, little brother, and my 3 nieces. Bro and I racked up 5,000+ tickets for the girls to spend on prizes. Came home and finished up NaNoWriMo, getting in all 50k words a day early, even though this month was rife with days so full of depression I wanted to just give up on it entirely and binge watch tv or play video games instead.So actually feeling a little bit more productive than usual. Then I get an email from my boss. So around November 14th, he tells me I need to ""pause"" work until December 5th due to some cash flow issues that he needs to straighten out. I'm not happy with this but I can't do anything about it because I work remotely from home as a contract employee. But today's email tells me that all of my accounts are being deactivated to ""save money"" and that he hopes the team can get up and functional again in January and he hopes I'll be part of the team then.So I'm essentially now unemployed for all of December which means Christmas is going to suck even more than usual, and I'm probably going to spend the next couple of weeks struggling with the heavier bouts of depression and anxiety again.I've been applying for jobs both remote and local for two months now and I haven't gotten anything, no bites at all. It's just really discouraging and I am losing all of my confidence, and maybe I thought reddit would have nice things to say to help cheer me up a little.

I just feel like I have nothing going for me anymore. The only thing I can say Im motivated about is starting up my own kicking camp to teach high school football kickers the most important techniques and tips for training and in game situations.

My heart sank....because....I'm the type of person who never buys anything for myself because I have always been broke. I have been scammed out of money through my parents. I have had precious items sold from under my nose by family.....I once had a $100 electoric guitar and $50 amp bought for christmas one year....I didn't even have that for a year. I went to school one day came back and it was gone. My older brother walks in and said he had to sell my guitar and amp to help pay for his rent which was a joke cause he was doing drugs at the time. I was taught by my foster parents that everything had a price for it even if it was a gift so I get really anxious when someone gives me a gift cause I think, ""Oh shit what's the price for taking this?"" I just... I felt really bad that even though I was able to get like $14 of drinks and two cool bracelets too.

I informed his mother of the situation and he proceeded to angrier with me.&amp;#x200B;Incident 6Partner and I are relaxing by the swimming pool and his phone is being used to play music. It starts to get late so I collect all of his belongings and try to turn his pandora off when I noticed his phone was accessible. I do the unthinkable and start looking through his phone. I only did this because early in the day he was acting very strangely and purposefully start arguments with me out of thin air. I ask him whats going on and he protests that nothing is the matter. We take pictures but I just have this gut feeling about him because he is starting issues with me for no apparent reason. I go through his phone and find him talking to TWO other females and making plans to visit them and talking about my son with them. I get enraged and start verbally attacking him as soon as I see him. I say everything possible that was on my mind and more all in front of his family.,I informed his mother of the situation and he proceeded to angrier with me.&amp;#x200B;Incident 6Partner and I are relaxing by the swimming pool and his phone is being used to play music.

"Ive been feeling kinda down and ugly lately. If you check my profile, you would see that a lot of the recent stuff I posted is similar in idea. I really want to talk to my crush but it would never work out because hes way out of my league. And Im serious. He plays baseball so hes fit, hes super super smart (AP classes! And he never does the precalc hw but he does great every test), hes humble (when I told him I got a hundred on my English midterm, he seemed genuinely happy even thought hes in much higher level classes than me), and hes fairly attractive.Ugh, hes probably the most mischievous little person around his friends and then hes nice- almost shy- with people that arent his friends.  And his face turns bright red, its adorable. He would never like me back. My friends say Im pretty but I think theyre lying. Im not the dumbest (my precalc grade would argue otherwise) and Ill admit Im in honor classes and Ive got a poem published in a book but thats about it. I try to stay fit too so its not like, health wise, were super different. I dont think it could ever work out anyways and I dont think his friends would approve of him dating me and I also think that  he would probably go chase the pretty girls that are also in the AP classes and equally as smart as him. I dont know what to do anymore. Hes all this cool stuff and Im just me and I wish he wasnt so out of my league. Im 16 btw if that changes anything ","Ive been feeling kinda down and ugly lately.

"I have a shitty job and a very unsupportive family. While having dinner, I told them about my plans to leave my full time job and build my own career on freelancing. Not even a minute in my explanation and theyve already bombarded me with a lot of questions and doubt. I know freelancing is hard like really really hard but its something that makes me happy (I currently have a part time job which is essentially what Ill be doing as a freelancer) and I know starting from the very beginning will be extremely hard but Im mentally prepared for it. Ive also saved enough money to live for a year which Im confident that Ill be able to get clients by then. It just hurts to know that none of the people I consider the closest to me support me in what I want to do. Its seriously taking a toll to my mental health. Ive been wanting to do this since last year but I just didnt have the right skills and financial stability yet. Now I know Im ready but it feels like its dragging me down with all the doubt that my family has around me. I easily get affected by what other people tell me which sucks big time. Im currently organizing my portfolio and other starting a freelancing career stuff right now and feeling really depressed. Uplift me please?

"Im 19, in college about to finish my freshman year. Im sitting in the kitchen of my parents house. I dont want to tell them how I feel because I dont want to be a burden. Ive told my friends, but I feel like a burden to them, even after they try to encourage me. My best friend for the best 11 years was put down yesterday. The girl Ive been talking to may or may not have just blocked my number for reasons I dont know. I dont feel like I belong anywhere. Im tired, I feel weak, Im scared, and I feel alone even though I know Im not. I dont know why I feel this way. I have to fight to find the motivation to get out of bed every morning.","Im 19, in college about to finish my freshman year. Im sitting in the kitchen of my parents house.

"And at that point,, i had spent so much time focusing on talents and being loved, that i lost my enjoyment. And once i lost my enjoyment,, there was nothing left. But people came to me,, they came to ME!! for art!! It was stunning, until i realized that that's all i was. A source of talent. They ripped those pieces I'd worked so hard for out of my hands and kicked me to the dirt. And from then on, the prices got bigger. I learned how to paint, i became the soloist of my choir, i learned to cook. Nothing was enough. Eventually, i even started offering money or items for love, and even my body.","And at that point,, i had spent so much time focusing on talents and being loved, that i lost my enjoyment.

"So. Im a near-first-time cosplayer, and Im not very confident in myself. For reference, Im in middle school (Almost done!), so confidence doesnt necessarily come easily. My sister and her entire friend group cosplay a bunch and sometimes, when I look at their cosplays, I think theyre way better than mine ever could be, even though I know theyre older and more experienced. Im actually in my Tanjiro cosplay right now, and I want to post it to /r/cosplay, but Im really scared someone will diss me because its not good or I dont have contacts or something. This is kind of a stupid problem and pretty light compared to some of the other, heavier stuff on this subreddit.","So. Im a near-first-time cosplayer, and Im not very confident in myself.

"So, I've been best friends for a year and a half with a girl(I am a guy) and I'm talking the kind of friendship that we can tell each other anything and everything and know that the other isn't going to judge and is just there to listen and give advice.In November I finally told her that I had feelings for her after debating in my head for 4 months. She said she also had feelings for me and we were proud of each other for finally letting it out. However, ever since then it feels like there is a rift in the friendship that I had zero intention of creating, you see, I never fully wanted to get into a relationship as she had just started her freshman year of college and I am in my Junior year of highschool(we're only a year apart in age) so we were both stressed with school. I was just tired of holding it in and wanted to get it off my chest.As it stands now, we still talk but it's not the same. It's not the deep talks we used to have, she won't talk to me about anything that's bothering her, and there is something, she's said so multiple times, I just can't get her to open up anymore. I don't know what I did or how to fix it and it's driving me crazy and it's making me feel like giving up on everything. She's the kind of friend that I really don't want to lose and would rather keep as a best friend than ruin that by getting into a relationship. If anyone has any advice at all, it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.","So, I've been best friends for a year and a half with a girl(I am a guy) and I'm talking the kind of friendship that we can tell each other anything and everything and know that the other isn't going to judge and is just there to listen and give advice.In November I finally told her that I had feelings for her after debating in my head for 4 months.

"I've got my recipes and all my ingredients, but my brain (Which is very good at self-sabotage) has come up with an outcome I'm having trouble dealing with. Putting aside the anxiety I'm feeling about just giving them to her, I'm utterly *terrified* she's going to think this is some kind of assholish passive-aggressive one-upmanship because I'm making the cannoli rather than buying it like she did with the cheesecake. I could just buy the cannoli and cut all this out, but tracking down the recipes and making them has and will help with the anxiety about giving them to her. I also feel the situation calls for the extra effort. I'll most likely say this when I give them to her, but that doesn't make the thought go away or the whole thing any less daunting.So have at me r/encouragement. Advice, encouragement, wisdom, please send word.","I've got my recipes and all my ingredients, but my brain (Which is very good at self-sabotage) has come up with an outcome I'm having trouble dealing with.

"So, I really want to start up taking acting classes as I've always wanted to act, like really badly. There are plenty of teenage classes near where I live that I would love to try out but I don't have anybody to go with. Acting classes feel like a thing where people would definitely bring a friend along to help them feel less awkward and so i'm sure that everyone in the classes will have at least one person that they know.The problem I have is that none of my friends are remotely interested in acting and wouldn't join the classes with me. I'm trying to get the courage to go alone but right now i'm way too scared to sign up. Any advice on how to not be such a wimp or how to find a friend that likes acting?

"I always wanted to act for the passion not because I need to fulfill something egotistical. When I would ask my family as a child to do beauty pageants, modeling or even acting, they would lsugh in my face and tell me I dont look like one. At 10 years old, I was bullied at school for my red hair, dark complexion, green eyes, small lips, big nose with a slight bump and a beauty mark. Imagine going home and telling your family you had big dreams and just like the school kids, they tell you youre not good looking. I recall drawing my face and writing, nose job, mole removal, lip injections, hair needs to be blonde. I presented this to a few adults in my family because they were the ones who told me when I was 8 I needed lip injections, nose job and blonde hair. Some were horrified. Some were agreeing that when I was of age we can start making me beautiful. The older I became, the more people would find my mixed looks to be exotic. I felt good for once. I felt I grew into my looks and I trusted my family would still help me with the surgeries because only then, maybe I could seek their approval for my dreams.There were many times I would say my dreams aloud and people would tell me they wouldnt happen. They claimed Im average looking and nothing special.","I always wanted to act for the passion not because I need to fulfill something egotistical.

"I grew up in a home where the only point of existing as a girl was to get married, be a good wife and have kids. When I failed to get married in my 20s, and now am in my almost mid 30s, I am considered a failure by my religious family. It doesnt matter that Ive moved alone, found a job to support myself, had to learn absolutely everything on my own.  My mom doesnt care and wonders why I wont just settle for a guy who will make money. That guy has never come along and I didnt have the option of being homeless and jobless.Yesterday I finally researched in detail about ux (user interaction) design. I finally learned about the process and how I could start this path.For the first time this year I have felt hopeful. Its been such a bad year, so many horrible things happened. I had a legit near death experience a few months ago and had to deal with legal research and consequences of that.For the first time I feel hopeful even though Im alone and have no one to be happy for me.","I grew up in a home where the only point of existing as a girl was to get married, be a good wife and have kids.

"Hi, I'm a compsci major. I need to take like 4-5 math courses to fill my requirements. I'm an international student and I've been battling with depression since semester 1 and now here I am in my 4th semester and I still haven't been able to pass calc 1. I transferred to another school a semester ago where I got a bit better from my depression but I still fucked up and flunk calc 1 for the 3rd time.

I'm an international student and I've been battling with depression since semester 1 and now here I am in my 4th semester and I still haven't been able to pass calc 1. I transferred to another school a semester ago where I got a bit better from my depression but I still fucked up and flunk calc 1 for the 3rd time.

"I joined a discord server awhile ago that has a couple of my friends. This server also has their friends, and one of them is a jerk. I was just in a huge argument with him. He instigated it and insulted me a lot more then I did him. In the discord we tried to make it like a democracy. Then this guy came and ruined it. He has no respect and really just a sucky guy. I can tell his parents are either overwhelmed with a lot of kids or their bad people. He clearly doesnt get the support he needs and hes a bully. I just left the discord and Im trying to get some of my friends to join my new one but only one has joined and he says he might not stay for long. I really need some encouragement right now, so Im asking a bunch of internet strangers. P.s. taking a walk to cool down hopefully it makes me feel better.Update: one of my friends was trying to force us to talk before I was ready. After a bit I got to stop.

"I guess Ill explain my situation. For about 3 months now Ive been talking to this girl. After our first date she said she didnt feel anything for me and so I tried to move on. After about a week of not talking to her she texted me asking how my day was. Since that day she started talking to me non stop every day. She then started to get kind of flirty and lead me on. When I talked to her about it, she said she was confused because she didnt feel anything originally and now she thinks things are changing. I was excited and so I just kept doing what I was doing and things were going great. Things went bad on Friday the 27th. The subject of our relationship status got brought up again and she said she was conflicted and part of her wants to just remain friends and part of her wants something more. I asked her if we could talk about it in person but we had to end up FaceTiming. It turns out all that flirting and leading on was her intentionally doing that to see if she was interested. What I took as affection turned out to be experimentation and at this point she was trying to avoid telling me the truth. Ive been rejected before but this one was different.","I guess Ill explain my situation. For about 3 months now Ive been talking to this girl.

I know freelancing is hard like really really hard but its something that makes me happy (I currently have a part time job which is essentially what Ill be doing as a freelancer) and I know starting from the very beginning will be extremely hard but Im mentally prepared for it. Ive also saved enough money to live for a year which Im confident that Ill be able to get clients by then. It just hurts to know that none of the people I consider the closest to me support me in what I want to do. Its seriously taking a toll to my mental health. Ive been wanting to do this since last year but I just didnt have the right skills and financial stability yet.

"Hi reddit, I'm in serious need of some encouragement words or some advice. Anything will do really.

My Job was very stressful but it was my only source of income, I think I made the right decision by quitting but I'm in a tough spot right now.As you can imagine, working on a thesis is no easy feat and as of this moment I feel incredibly anxious, depressed and overwhelmed. I'm short of time and even shorter on motivation and willingness to live. I have no other income than my savings and I'm living with my parents. I also have to spend ALL the fucking day alone, working on my thesis and taking care of myself.I just don't know what to do anymore and it is only making me more anxious and overwhelmed. If maybe some of you could give me some advice or encouraging words, that would be great!Thank you so much for reading.","Hi reddit, I'm in serious need of some encouragement words or some advice.

"So, I've been best friends for a year and a half with a girl(I am a guy) and I'm talking the kind of friendship that we can tell each other anything and everything and know that the other isn't going to judge and is just there to listen and give advice.In November I finally told her that I had feelings for her after debating in my head for 4 months. She said she also had feelings for me and we were proud of each other for finally letting it out. However, ever since then it feels like there is a rift in the friendship that I had zero intention of creating, you see, I never fully wanted to get into a relationship as she had just started her freshman year of college and I am in my Junior year of highschool(we're only a year apart in age) so we were both stressed with school. I was just tired of holding it in and wanted to get it off my chest.As it stands now, we still talk but it's not the same. It's not the deep talks we used to have, she won't talk to me about anything that's bothering her, and there is something, she's said so multiple times, I just can't get her to open up anymore. I don't know what I did or how to fix it and it's driving me crazy and it's making me feel like giving up on everything. She's the kind of friend that I really don't want to lose and would rather keep as a best friend than ruin that by getting into a relationship. If anyone has any advice at all, it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.Update: She has a bf and hast spoken to me in almost 3 months. Thanks for all the advice, I've just given up at this point.","So, I've been best friends for a year and a half with a girl(I am a guy) and I'm talking the kind of friendship that we can tell each other anything and everything and know that the other isn't going to judge and is just there to listen and give advice.In November I finally told her that I had feelings for her after debating in my head for 4 months.

"Hey guys on August of 2018 I started the process of joining the USAF and it's been kind of stressful. I went MEPs(Military Entrance Processing Station) couple months back and got medically disqualified for something called Subtalar Ankylosis, I have no medical history or this and I feel as though I have been misdiagnosed. However I was told that I could get a waiver to join the USAF and that waiver has to be approved by the Surgeon General of the Air Force. My file was sent up last week and I don't know how long it will be and I am so worried I am going to get denied. People have told me the AF doesn't need recruits right now or that they never approve medical waivers. I'm down about this so any encouragement would be appreciated thanks guys ","Hey guys on August of 2018 I started the process of joining the USAF and it's been kind of stressful.

"I am studying to get a bachelors degree and currently have a month of examinations in my school and I am beyond tired. I am also working 24 hours per week at job so I could live on my own, pay the bills, pay for food. Not a dream job, but it pays the bills. Tommorow I have an exam in a subject that I was not attending for almost half a semester because being there in lectures is just as useless as just not being there. (Was doing other homework in the meantime though, so suppose it was more useful to not be there in the end). About this particular subject I am completely clueless and I should gather my strengths today so I could get past 'fail' tommorow. But I just want to be lazy for once so badly !  I want to do something for my personal goals, I want to spend some more time with my boyfriend, I want to meet my mom, I want a whole day just at home. I like my studies because it is finally something I am very much interested in (except tomorrows exam, but it's only a small part of everything). Still it is hard. I wrote myself a letter in the beginning in autumn that was delivered to my during this hard time of exams. I had forgotten about it and I was very moved when I received it. My past self says that she hops that I am just as inspired as she is at the moment and hopes I am getting enough rest and she is very proud of me. The last part is the one that moved me so much, I think I just don't get enough reassurement that I am doing enough. I should not be depending on other's peoples reassurement though, but my own, is it not right? But I am soo busy and sad","I am studying to get a bachelors degree and currently have a month of examinations in my school and I am beyond tired.

"Hi all, I'm a nurse, working in the time of Covid. All politics aside, its just a really hard time to be a nurse. Long hours, frayed tempers, everyone is on edge.

I come from a big family. We must update each other every week on how we have been. Negative points if you don't make the weekly Skype. Even more negative if you dont 'bring it'and show how you are 'crushing Covid.'I'm so tired. I have about 10% gas left in my tank. I just need a smile, or a nod, or a 'sup' just to say that regardless of where we are, it's going to be okay.","Hi all, I'm a nurse, working in the time of Covid.

"Im a freshman in college and recently I moved about an hour away from home to attend school. The past few months have been absolutely dreadful, from moving in to an apartment to being late on rent every single month. My parents are separated so theyre always fighting over who should help me when money gets tight. Ive ran through about 3 jobs at my new location and cant seem to find the best job to keep me steady. I turn 20 literally on Friday and the fact that Im 20 with no stable income and barely getting by is killing my motivation and the way I want to handle things in life. I just feel like I have nothing going for me anymore. The only thing I can say Im motivated about is starting up my own kicking camp to teach high school football kickers the most important techniques and tips for training and in game situations. Besides that I cant find something to hold on to that would keep my head high and keep my motivation running. I just feel lost and empty and I wish I could ask for help but I know Ive already asked too many times.

"I had to pull over in a parking lot because it was too dangerous to continue to drive. At the time, my car did not have AC and I had my son in the backseat taking him to daycare. I call my partner to inform him that I needed his help because my car was disabled. He asked me to drop a pin at my location and I did but it gave the incorrect address, so I gave him the actual address of where I was. Instead of coming to get me, he started to rant about not wanting to be on the road searching for me. I get irritated and curse at him and from then on he argued me to death about he is doing me a favor and that I shouldn't be talking to people in a certain way when I need something. He continued to refuse to come and get me and instructed me to find someone else to pick me up. When I did, he got upset that I even asked him and proceeded to argue with me for the rest of the day. During the arguments he stated that he wish he never met me and had a baby with me and stated that he wished his son was dead.","I had to pull over in a parking lot because it was too dangerous to continue to drive.

For 4 years I have been dating a high functioning autistic woman. (30) She lived with her parents for the entire duration. Recently her father quit his job because he couldnt take a vacation the days he wanted to.Within 3 days of hearing this story I was informed they would be moving across the state and that she would be going with them. Note at this time we had plans for marriage and had a great relationship.Today she ended our relationship. Her reasons where not her own they were the exact parrotings of her parents far right wing conservatives note that I am not white or conservative. We never let this affect anything or even talk about it. 3 months ago I had open heart surgery at 29. I now noticed since then things have gone downhill.Long story short she made me feel used worthless and broken. That I dont have my life together and cannot be a Provider. But I know these are not her words. Unfortunately nothing I say will bring her back. I just need some assurance Im not those things she said.

"Today was a great day. I spent the day at Chuck E. Cheese's with my mother, little brother, and my 3 nieces. Bro and I racked up 5,000+ tickets for the girls to spend on prizes. Came home and finished up NaNoWriMo, getting in all 50k words a day early, even though this month was rife with days so full of depression I wanted to just give up on it entirely and binge watch tv or play video games instead.So actually feeling a little bit more productive than usual. Then I get an email from my boss. So around November 14th, he tells me I need to ""pause"" work until December 5th due to some cash flow issues that he needs to straighten out. I'm not happy with this but I can't do anything about it because I work remotely from home as a contract employee. But today's email tells me that all of my accounts are being deactivated to ""save money"" and that he hopes the team can get up and functional again in January and he hopes I'll be part of the team then.So I'm essentially now unemployed for all of December which means Christmas is going to suck even more than usual, and I'm probably going to spend the next couple of weeks struggling with the heavier bouts of depression and anxiety again.I've been applying for jobs both remote and local for two months now and I haven't gotten anything, no bites at all. It's just really discouraging and I am losing all of my confidence, and maybe I thought reddit would have nice things to say to help cheer me up a little.

"Hi all!Im (40F) just looking for people to tell me its going to be ok. I suffer from anxiety disorder which means I overthink trying to figure out or solve my problems.    I get a physical reaction in my body when my anxiety rises up.    My heart races but also feels like it drops into my stomach.  My stomach starts twisting and flipping and getting jittery.  My face becomes flushed and I also feel light headed.Internally Im freaking out but tend to express it through irritation and anger.    And I know it is all fear based and fight or flight nervous system reaction.    I need to move at the end of the month and no matter how much I try to work the math, it looks like Im not going to have enough money to get it done.    Something has to give, meaning I might be able to pay rent and moving expenses but I might not be able to pay the electric bill or buy groceries for my kids.    I dont have any friends or family I can turn to for help. I know these things have a way of working themselves out but it still fucking terrifies me.    Im trying to think of ways I can earn extra money outside of my full time minimum wage job.    Some encouragement is needed and I hope this is the right forum for this.

"The performance art not the card game.I'm getting hung up on starting magic as an adult. I'm normally not like this, there are \*very\* few things I feel self-conscious about but for some reason getting into this art as an adult, I feel a weird anxiousness about it.I did a few tricks in high school, studied as an actor in college (didn't go anywhere but I liked the experience) and generally the most animated in a group of friends, I think I'm pretty natural as an entertainer. I do not understand why I suddenly care so much about what people are gonna think to see a 26 year old doing beginner tricks. Especially since my friends are such good supporters, they wouldn't make fun of me even if I super flubbed a trick.I understand confidence is a big factor in magic, in any performance art so I'd love to hear some inspiring words to help me shake off this apprehension.Thank you all ahead of time!","The performance art not the card game.I'm getting hung up on starting magic as an adult. I'm normally not like this, there are \*very\* few things I feel self-conscious about but for some reason getting into this art as an adult, I feel a weird anxiousness about it.I did a few tricks in high school, studied as an actor in college (didn't go anywhere but I liked the experience) and generally the most animated in a group of friends, I think I'm pretty natural as an entertainer.

"Tried to go back to warehouse work but the pain in my legs, feet, hips and back was excruciating. Only lasted 3 months. Husband was the bread winner and I did literally everything else. All he had to do was bring home a check. I scheduled appointments, paid bills, cleaned the house, planned meals, grocery shopped, etc. I was already doing that while also working. It was nice to only do one side of it. We bought a house. 1 month later my husband lost his job of 7 years. In the 2 years since, he has worked a total of 5 months. We cashed out his 401k. It lasted a year. I tried another call center. Cried so they let me go. We don't have the money for food, but Im trying to eat right and exercise anyways. Husband refuses to work. He won't clean. He won't talk to me about our future. He won't get his driver's license. Still wants sex though, even though it's painful to me and I need to see a gyno. Im happy he still wants me. Im afraid he will stop one day. Im still doing everything.","Tried to go back to warehouse work but the pain in my legs, feet, hips and back was excruciating. Only lasted 3 months.

"A little background. I'm 36, male, 290lbs, and found out that I'm diabetic about a year and a half ago.  I'm still overweight and trying the Atkins diet now.  I have been recording my walks to track them to see if I'm improving on my time. Today I pushed myself a little bit harder and tracked a 14 minute and 17 seconds mile. So far that's my fastest mile pace. I was very proud of this achievement because it's been awhile since I've gotten under 15 minutes. Not really looking for any type of advice to make it better just a little bit of encouragement that I didn't receive when I got home. Thanks.","A little background.

"I came back to the apartment a short time later and told him, ""I am not keeping your son away from you, but I think it's best that I go home with my because we are not getting a long at the moment."" I created space between the both of us, so he would not feel as if I was in his space or threatening him.

All of a sudden, he is choking me very aggressively. I defended myself by slapping, kicking and scratching him to get off me. He puts me in full nelson and slams me on the couch. I fall on the floor and the altercation is still occurring and I'm still defending myself by kicking and hitting him in the leg. He punches me the jaw and backs up.","I came back to the apartment a short time later and told him, ""I am not keeping your son away from you, but I think it's best that I go home with my because we are not getting a long at the moment.""

"I have a part-time retail job which admittedly I love, mostly because of an awesome manager. But it's not enough to live on, so I'm planning to get some electrician training. There's always a market for that, they're unionized, and I love working with my hands. So far, so good. I've located a technical college that:\- is less than half an hour from my house (\*super convenient\*)\- has a six-month certificate program (\*not so short that it feels incomplete, not so long that I get frustrated\*)\- offers job placement assistance after graduation (\*SCORE!\*)\- classes start at 7:45 AM (\*record scratch sound effect...\*)Oh dear. There's a reason I work the evening shift. I know this is a petty thing to get hung up on in the face of such an otherwise-perfect opportunity, but it's been a VERY long time since I've been required to get up early on a regular basis. And now I'm on medication with a side effect of insomnia. My current situation is unsustainable, and these early classes will allow me to stick with my usual evening shift; but I have a long history of being easily discouraged and can already feel myself backpedaling. I need someone to talk me out of talking myself out of this.","I have a part-time retail job which admittedly I love, mostly because of an awesome manager.

"I'm a 20 year old guy who struggles with bipolar depression. I attend college but honestly have no real clue what I wanna do with my life, I have a very strong interest in mathematics though and would love to help advance technology. Last semester I got straight As but sacrificed my social life for it, and now even when I try to make friends at school, nobody shares similar interests to myself or cares to pay any attention to me. Everyone else just cares about stuff I don't care about like drugs or video games, I want to get out and explore new things. I love action sports but I have lost interest recently due to both my depression and lack of friends to bike and skate with. I really need a girl in my life to help me, I have a more sensitive side that I'm showing now that needs to be vented. Ive only kissed or had a relationship with one girl ever and she cheated on me after two weeks. I am such a sincere and open-minded person and girls always turn me down, or claim to really like me a friend ( I'm fine with that) and later avoid me. Finally, I met an adorable girl recently who I connect with so well, but she only wanted to be friends, which I agreed to, yet now she always has a lame excuse to ignore me.

"I was always criticized by my foster dad growing up. I learned that sharing my ideas, interests and hobbies will always been seen as weird. It's made me struggle with talking to new people and even made me fearful for thinking about making friends. I have accepted the fact that I am seen as weird and that has made me socially anxious to make friends. I can't even look at a person in the eyes without thinking I look weird. I've grew up going through certain events that made me shut myself off from the world and be ashamed to share my interests and not know who I really am. I'm going to be 29 this week....And I feel like I have learned about things in life so late and that that makes me so under developed. I know though that I will get over it and that I will learn to accept myself and find out how I am but trying to break a pattern you have been dealing with for 27 years is the hardest thing I am going through.","I was always criticized by my foster dad growing up.

"Hi all, Im 22 and Im stressed out. Admittedly I thrive in tense and high stress situations. I come from a conservative, Christian, middle class family in PA.  Im an only child and I still live at home. I dont have my own car and Im one year out from finishing my degree. I decided to join the Army National Guard to find my last year of college. Times are getting rough at home. Parents are done paying for school, rightfully so, but refuse to co-sign on any loans. Knowing this, I enlisted into the Guard. Well two days before I was supposed to ship for Basic Training I found out I was pregnant. The man isnt my official boyfriend, we have been involved for over a year but we got back together after a big break up, just never officially stated were bf/gf. My parents dont approve, mostly because I painted him in a bad light to them and theyre stuck on me dating someone who fits in more with our family. They refuse to let me use any of their cars to drive to see him, and insist he picks me up. Well, at some point in time, eight weeks ago, I got pregnant. When I didnt get my period, but still felt like I was having cramps, I thought nothing of it.","Hi all, Im 22 and Im stressed out. Admittedly I thrive in tense and high stress situations.

It was the happiest moment in my life, I told her I didnt want anyone else in my life only her and her daughter. We could all be happy together.

"I need some help. I'm having a lot of trouble mentally and don't want to burden friends and family with my issues. I don't want to burden anyone really. But I guess strangers are better in this scenario. Lately, I don't want to be here anymore. I don't necessarily want to kill myself persay just not exist. I'm feeling like a complete failure and that the world would be better off if I wasn't in it. I'm not remarkable. I'm not going to change the world (although that's what I thought I was suppose to do). At best I will live an average normal existence. I hate that in order to even remotely be alright I have to take medication for the rest of my life. Anxiety and depression overwhelm my life. It's been going on to varying degrees now for the last 20 years.  I've been everywhere from comatose on antianxieties to agoraphobic to disgusting because I can't even handle basic hygiene. Sometimes, every so often, I am actually happy. I think. But the demons always come back. I'm so tired of living this way. It effects every facet of my live. I've lost jobs, friends, relationships etc. It seems the only way to keep the demons away is to just cease to be here.  I've had another fairly bad episode this past week and I'm worried about my job. I'm worried about what my coworkers think. I'm worried about pretty much everything to be honest. The list is endless.

"Day in, day out, the news doesnt fail to update us on what it does best: BAD NEWS!!!Even though I desperately try to limit myself from indulging into daily news, i cant help but think sometimes.I used to read the news, every morning, right after my morning prayers and some days I will read before the prayers, telling myself that this way I can find more to pray about as if I could ever run short on reasons to pray. Little did I know what effect this intake of news - good and bad - was having on my physical, emotional and even spiritual well-being. So I made a drastic decision to step back a little. But truth is that the news follows us everywhere, it is on our fingertips.However recently I came across a repetitive title that I tried to ignore for a while but it always caught up with me: SUICIDE!!!This 7 letters word has changed and turned millions of peoples lives in directions they wouldnt have chosen otherwise. Suicide has dimmed the light of joy and peace in so many individuals and brought guilt and suffering to those who are staying behind.Suicide has finally made it on my top list of the ugliest words in human history alongside abuse, violence, rape, and bullying.Why should you voluntarily end your life? I would ask. Why shouldnt you if there is no reason, and joy to live?, they would tell me.To all those out there who are considering or thinking of suicide, I am sorry to tell you that  suicide is simply a permanent solution to a temporary problem. And I want to believe that,  when suicide becomes an option, it is not mainly to end life, but to end the pain.","Day in, day out, the news doesnt fail to update us on what it does best: BAD NEWS!!!Even though I desperately try to limit myself from indulging into daily news, i cant help but think sometimes.I used to read the news, every morning, right after my morning prayers and some days I will read before the prayers, telling myself that this way I can find more to pray about as if I could ever run short on reasons to pray.

"I've taken on a 3-year university course that is said to be really tough, but it's something I'm truly interested in. The thing about this university is that there is no project work, no presentation or participation points to help my grade- EVERYTHING is based on the results of a year-end exam. Last year, I failed ALL my modules and had to resit them, which makes me one year behind. This year, I managed to clear two of my toughest modules, but I failed the other two, which means that I now will take 5 years to graduate.My parents and friends are telling me not to beat myself up over it, but I can't help but feel so, so disappointed that I did not pass everything. I had such expectations for myself too.I guess I really feel insecure about graduating a lot later than everyone else I know. I feel really depressed that I can't do well in something that I like.","I've taken on a 3-year university course that is said to be really tough, but it's something I'm truly interested in.

Hello everyone!This is my first post on Reddit. I haven't been feeling too well lately I was throwing up and had a really low blood pressure due to anxiety ups and downs and I injured a part of my back on my birthday today and could hardly walk because of all the pain. Just felt kind of lonely since I have also had a hard time emotionally lately due to a lot of stress and don't really have friends or family like people that knew at all where I am and it's just raining the whole time lol. Still glad I have my bf with me :)Thanks everyone ,Hello everyone!This is my first post on Reddit.

I have a stepmother, but she and I have a very strained relationship and she is very critical of me and expresses her disapproval of how I do things all the time.  My father was my best friend. However, she's said a few things to me about how my father viewed me as having ""issues"".I have one brother, but we are not close. I do not have children.I have to wonder if there is something wrong with me. I feel I am the nicest person and quite easy to get along with. I have 4 excellent friends who are helping me hold everything together.I feel like I don't have anyone and I like I don't have any family. I have cried and hurt so much over my husband leaving that now I just don't care anymore. The hurts are piling on to where I just feel  indifferent.","Going through a tough time in my life. 37F.

"Ive been on a downward spiralMy fianc and I have moved in together at the start of 2020, which either highlighted or exposed some major dependency issues that she has. On top of that, her mental health has been beyond terrible for herwhich is likely a huge driving force for the dependencyand Ive gotten Caregivers Fatigue 3 or 4 times already. I desperately want to communicate this issue but she can already read it off of me (been together for a long time) which is making her mental health worse at times, and I think if we were to outright have that conversation it would cause her mental health to be even worse. She also gets upset that it seems like I view her as helpless and unable to function without me, and admittedly I do because shes so extremely needyI hate myself physically. Literally from my head to my toes: I cant find a good haircut and the barber that I helped out with that couldnt be consistent, then COVID hit and Im out a barber &amp; reference point for my hair. Im in too low of a funk to consistently care about maintaining my beard which is as frustrating as daily care would be. Ive been gaining fat all of 2020 which not only do I want to lose weight but Im also a nutrition major so thats not a good look.","Ive been on a downward spiralMy fianc and I have moved in together at the start of 2020, which either highlighted or exposed some major dependency issues that she has.

"And when it came to singing with anyone, I always considered myself a back-up singer. I'm just someone with a soft voice, and I harmonise, I told myself that's the way it is. I should never sing as a lone voice, or sing a melody. That's also why I always had to make sure I sang really short parts of a song, or made sure to sing with my fiance (and I love his voice, he's amazing). It was to the point I wouldn't sing anything without him, I was hiding behind himAnyway, I loaded my first video tonight. Tried practising but kept making mistakes, I was paranoid cause I didn't have makeup and was just in my PJs, but I wanted to stop getting myself down and just do it! My close friend gave helpful advice, just do it and get better, don't be afraid to fail :) I'm embarrassed to share the video, but I really do want to get better and I appreciate any support (and constructive feedback :p)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feArZr8zWG0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feArZr8zWG0)","And when it came to singing with anyone, I always considered myself a back-up singer.

"Using reddit is really nice, it helps me realize that Im not alone in the world. That others have problems just like me, often times worse. This year has been such a rollercoaster ride of hurt feelings, destroyed dreams, and missed opportunities. I found out this year that Im bi. And now Im in a relationship with another guy. My family (heavily Baptist) havent found out and I dont plan on telling them for as long as possible. Same story for my bf only worse. I worry for him, what if they find out? What if it ends? The US is now a flawed democracy and the only thing we have to look forward to is a ffffffucking civil war. My minds full of doubt all the time telling me that I wont be good enough. After all, whats the use in getting an education if people wont listen to the educated? I guess this is just me venting. I know others have issues bigger than me/mine. And I know that doesnt mean my problems dont mean something. Pain is relative to the person experiencing it. Honestly Im ready for the year to end. For new opportunities to come. And the chance for a better life in the future. I have a journal that I put my rants in but I just felt like putting this on reddit for whatever reason.

"I left my pub job a few weeks ago due to difficulties with management. To keep things short and sweet, they lacked both social and managerial skills needed for said job and honestly just doesn't know how to treat human beings. So i left, mid shift, and never came back.

"He starts to berate me again and follow me throughout the house and outside. When we were outside his tune changed and tried to make it seem as if I was being crazy for no reason. I entered the house as long as he was away from me. As soon as I entered the house, he started verbally attacking me. I start to defend myself and continue to let him know that he was out of line. Did I say what I needed to nicely? I didn't. What he was dishing to me, I gave it back to him. He wanted me to stop talking and when I refused to not be heard after he insulted me, he started choking me several times in front of his mother, sister, 8 year old nephew, and my 7 month old infant son.","He starts to berate me again and follow me throughout the house and outside.

Trying to forget.My town has a decent school, so I applied and was accepted. Returning to school after ~10 years feels weird. Its a struggle, in fact. I went in feeling confident, but... something is wrong. Scored 95% and 92% on the first two exams of my most challenging class, but basically flunked everything else in my other classes.Part of me just... died. I feel like I peeked behind the curtain and cant return to reality in the same way. I can barely take care of myself. I dont *want* to take care of myself.

"Hey,, i know it's usually people asking for advice around here, but i recently had a friend needing comfort when it came to talent,, and i think some people need to hear this,,,So, I'm 16. Not old, i know,, but I've seen more than most people at 20 have and im almost sure of it. I was raised in a very neglectful home,, and Im autistic, nonbinary and physically disabled to top it off. When i was younger, alot of my life was spent in isolation to avoid the sensory overloads or hate that came from being in public, along with the fact that i didn't fit in with anyone no matter where i went. My parents didn't bother to do much when it came to helping me,, only really talking to me if it had something to do with things they were angry with me about,,, so of course, i started wondering,, what is it that i dont have? Why does nobody anywhere like me? And i couldn't seem to figure it out,, no matter how hard i tried to be kinder, or to fit their needs, it only caused me greater pain. And then i got into drawing. Drawing was my first passion,, my first love,, until talent came along. I spent all my days alone, as usual, except this time was no longer spent in silence, sketching the plants and animals nearby, It was spent trying to build a talent. I spent hours and hours of time neglected by others, wripping up scraps of whatever paper i could find, crying for a talent. Something people would love me for, and something i could use to make people want to love me!","Hey,, i know it's usually people asking for advice around here, but i recently had a friend needing comfort when it came to talent,, and i think some people need to hear this,,,So, I'm 16.

"I'm in a very strange period right now and I'm still trying to figure it out, but I'll try to describe it the best I can. Events in chronological order:During the quarantine, I took the time to workout and eat better. I had the discipline and the determination to lose weight and get fitter.Since June, work has been stressful, because of upcoming deadlines. I got me in a procrastination-due-to-anxiety state. My work isn't great, but it's not terrible either. I'm planning on getting at least decent results before July.This weekend, we got very bad news in the family.Since then, I feel like I want to lose control of my life. A small and easy way to do it was to completely wreck my quarantine habits. I've been eating like an absolute mess and haven't worked-out at all for the last few days. I also haven't touched my musical instruments, which I normally practice pretty much every day. Everything is less fun, less interesting, less joyful, etc. I can be distracted for a while, but my energy level and general happiness is much lower than usual.

"Hey, 18 F here. I have pretty bad anxiety and i finally got the courage to schedule my driver's test a few weeks ago. I studied my heart out, took 11 pages of notes on the driver's manual, and i thought i was ready. But I missed a stop sign and that's an automatic failure. I never even saw the damn thing because there was a tree branch in the way, and ended up missing a second one because I sort of went into a panicked state and shut down. When I parked and the lady told me a failed, i started bawling and I ended up crying all the way home and for a few hours after that. My dad (bless his heart) ended up having to call me out of work because when the time came around I was still crying and refused to get out of bed. Having a license is a really big thing for me because it's the next step in becoming completely independent and the bridge toward being able to finally quit my shitty job, move out, and get away from my kind of abusive mom.","Hey, 18 F here.

"I guess Ill explain my situation. For about 3 months now Ive been talking to this girl. After our first date she said she didnt feel anything for me and so I tried to move on. After about a week of not talking to her she texted me asking how my day was. Since that day she started talking to me non stop every day. She then started to get kind of flirty and lead me on. When I talked to her about it, she said she was confused because she didnt feel anything originally and now she thinks things are changing. I was excited and so I just kept doing what I was doing and things were going great. Things went bad on Friday the 27th. The subject of our relationship status got brought up again and she said she was conflicted and part of her wants to just remain friends and part of her wants something more. I asked her if we could talk about it in person but we had to end up FaceTiming. It turns out all that flirting and leading on was her intentionally doing that to see if she was interested. What I took as affection turned out to be experimentation and at this point she was trying to avoid telling me the truth. Ive been rejected before but this one was different.","I guess Ill explain my situation. For about 3 months now Ive been talking to this girl.

"I try to comfort him and tell him that wasn't true. He starts pushing me and yelling out loud that I'm trash and a liar. I'm trying to defend myself and he tells me to shut the fuck up. We walk to the car and while driving I tell him that he was being ridiculous and getting upset over non-trivial things once again. He proceeds to slap my phone off of my stand in my car and stomp on it. I become irate and start telling him how I didn't appreciate him destroying property. We get back to his mother's house and she can tell something is wrong with me. So, I ask to speak to her one on one to show her what he did to my phone. Instead of letting me talk in private he intrudes on our conversation and starts antagonizing me telling me that I don't know how to keep my mouth shut and our business is between me and him.","I try to comfort him and tell him that wasn't true.

"For reasons I won't get into, I think my abusive ex-boyfriend might commit suicide tomorrow. I hate this person more than I can express to you. He singlehandedly ruined large portions of my life. But I don't think he deserves to die. I don't think anyone deserves to feel like this.I can't contact the authorities without ensuring the removal of his full-ride scholarship with the promise of a job at the end. I think I'm going to anonymously call his parents tonight and let them make that judgement call because it's not my decision to make. They know him best. But I'm so scared. I haven't spoken to his parents in years. If they recognize my voice and tell him, he'll talk about me behind my back, which will just push me closer to wanting to die myself. He might even contact me himself, which would be the most traumatizing thing I can think of. He might not even go through with it, I don't want to scare his parents without reason. I don't want them to think this was just a shitty, shitty prank. But better safe than sorry, right...?","For reasons I won't get into, I think my abusive ex-boyfriend might commit suicide tomorrow.

"Hello, im not sure if i will continue to share my encouraging thought because people have been having problems because i use my faith to try to help people i was asked to only post everyother day because apperently im offending people, i dont understand why this offends anyone, if you dont want to read it then dont. But if you like these words of encouragement please respond!!! Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his Lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.
John 15:15 KJV
Dogs love is unconditional, always there for you, always glad to see you, ready to forgive you, love going places with you, will protect you from danger, and on and on. We would be fortunate to have a human friend who is faithful as a canine friend. Actually, we do have such a friend and such more than a four legged friend. That friend is Jesus and He understands everything we go through in life. Jesus can sympathize with our weaknesses. Human friends may disappoint us, but Jesus never will. He is a friend that ""sticks closer than a brother "" (Proverbs 18:24). Have a blessed weekend.  :)","Hello, im not sure if i will continue to share my encouraging thought because people have been having problems because i use my faith to try to help people i was asked to only post everyother day because apperently im offending people, i dont understand why this offends anyone, if you dont want to read it then dont.

"I recently got married, then my wife and I decided to foster, then we moved. All within a year and a half. We both use to be so active almost every day. I understand parenting is a priority but with this current child we literally cannot get out of the house. It's just too hard. I use to ride/run up to 20 miles a week and my wife use to run 10ish and do yoga 4 times a week. Now she is lucky to do yoga twice a month and I might get 30 minutes each week to run or ride. I'm kinda depressed, anxious about getting fat and catch myself slipping on my healthy foods. Wife feels the same. Im honestly just thinking about accepting my fate, buying larger clothes and just letting go. I dont want it but that's what seems to be happening.","I recently got married, then my wife and I decided to foster, then we moved. All within a year and a half.

I never really had the college experience when I got my bachelors, I didnt make that many friends, even though Im a social person. Im worried I cant do it and that Im not good enough.

"Hi reddit, I'm in serious need of some encouragement words or some advice. Anything will do really. I'm not very good at this but let's give it a try.I'm 24, recently had to quit my job in order to finish my thesis and being able to get my fucking college degree. My Job was very stressful but it was my only source of income, I think I made the right decision by quitting but I'm in a tough spot right now.As you can imagine, working on a thesis is no easy feat and as of this moment I feel incredibly anxious, depressed and overwhelmed. I'm short of time and even shorter on motivation and willingness to live. I have no other income than my savings and I'm living with my parents. I also have to spend ALL the fucking day alone, working on my thesis and taking care of myself.I just don't know what to do anymore and it is only making me more anxious and overwhelmed. If maybe some of you could give me some advice or encouraging words, that would be great!Thank you so much for reading.","Hi reddit, I'm in serious need of some encouragement words or some advice.

"A big question I think a lot of people are asking these days is why are we so depressed, why are we so anxious. We are more anxious and depressed these days because of our culture. With the internet and media we are under a microscope and we are constantly being pressured to be perfect. Perfect body, perfect skin, perfect routine, perfect eating habits, the way you sleep, the way the way you stand, the way you parent, perfect fulfilled fun lives. Every single thing we do we are pressured with the fact that we arent good enough. We arent doing it right. We arent doing it perfectly. We live in an illusion that some people are but its all just a magic trick. People put on a fake face. No one truly knows whats real anymore, so we sit there thinking we arent good enough, we arent as good as everyone else. We have access to all the bad news around the world like never  before. So on top of being perfect we have things like global warming, the entire world that needs to be fixed to worry about too. So let me just say this...Slow down. You will not be perfect. You will not live those glamorous lives you think are real. Just stop striving for perfect and start striving for your best, you will never fall short. Work hard, love hard, and take care of yourself.","A big question I think a lot of people are asking these days is why are we so depressed, why are we so anxious.

I just quit a job I loved and I've started at my new place.  They're really different but my old boss was abusive and careless to his employees and I couldn't take it anymore.  I went back to a place I had worked before and I also love it for different reasons.  I'm 28 and I haven't found a solid career.  My new job has offered to pay for classes to get my LTP as I work at a tax firm.  It's really tempting because I would get to stay here with people I love and the pay would be great but my old job was working with kids which i love more.  I want to continue working with kids but I would need to go back to school to have jobs that pay enough.I have anxiety and all of this change and stress has been getting to me.  I haven't cleaned my apartment in weeks.  My husband and I currently live in a low income apartment building which doesn't allow for full student households.  He is in school and if I take classes we would have to find another place to live.  All of this is stressing me out so much and my husband is stressed out and checked out.  I need anyone to talk to but I'm afraid to talk to my friends about this.  When I talk to my husband he doesn't say much.  I just need even a shred of support from anyone because the person I need it from the most is not in an emotional or mental place to give that.,I just quit a job I loved and I've started at my new place.

"I just made a big post in r/depression about how my life is wasting away. I know I need to do something about it. But every time I've ever tried, I've failed. But I'm not going to stop trying. 'm just so scared, of everything. I applied to a pet store a couple of months ago and never got a call. I figured, if they won't hire me, who will? I think I'm ready to try again. There's a little Japanese restaurant down the street that's not too busy, maybe I could handle it? I think I will go there today and ask about a job.","I just made a big post in r/depression about how my life is wasting away. I know I need to do something about it.

"I recently spent hours saving sad, depressing poems to my school computer. I am biromantic but have VERY christian, VERY homophobic parents.

"However, despite my hard work, my GPA isnt close to the 3.0 mark. As deadlines come and go, I realized the dream of going to medical school is slowly going away.I looked at so many masters programs or other programs to help boost my GPA but I always fall short of the requirements due to my overall GPA. My passion is the healthcare field, being able to help patients hands on and seeing the progression of getting them healthier over time but despite all that my GPA is whats holding me back. After thinking it through, speaking to other students, and other people in the profession, I decided rather than sitting around and wasting my time, I would be more proactive with it. Im not asking for forgiveness on my past academic records, but I was requisition some solid advice. Despite meeting everyone and anyone about my next step, no one seems to care too much and just tells me to leave the health care field out of my head and focus on something like HealthCare Management or business. I gave it some thought and decided I wanted to do nursing and become an RN and if cards fall right into my hand, use it as a stepping stone for a new career choice or new beginning. For too long now, I have felt like nothing I was doing was helping me. I just need some help and seeing if I officially meet the requirements and seeing what I need to do.","However, despite my hard work, my GPA isnt close to the 3.0 mark.

"Today was a great day. I spent the day at Chuck E. Cheese's with my mother, little brother, and my 3 nieces. Bro and I racked up 5,000+ tickets for the girls to spend on prizes. Came home and finished up NaNoWriMo, getting in all 50k words a day early, even though this month was rife with days so full of depression I wanted to just give up on it entirely and binge watch tv or play video games instead.So actually feeling a little bit more productive than usual. Then I get an email from my boss. So around November 14th, he tells me I need to ""pause"" work until December 5th due to some cash flow issues that he needs to straighten out. I'm not happy with this but I can't do anything about it because I work remotely from home as a contract employee. But today's email tells me that all of my accounts are being deactivated to ""save money"" and that he hopes the team can get up and functional again in January and he hopes I'll be part of the team then.So I'm essentially now unemployed for all of December which means Christmas is going to suck even more than usual, and I'm probably going to spend the next couple of weeks struggling with the heavier bouts of depression and anxiety again.I've been applying for jobs both remote and local for two months now and I haven't gotten anything, no bites at all. It's just really discouraging and I am losing all of my confidence, and maybe I thought reddit would have nice things to say to help cheer me up a little.

Maybe this is the right subreddit for that."
"I'm a 20 year old guy who struggles with bipolar depression. I attend college but honestly have no real clue what I wanna do with my life, I have a very strong interest in mathematics though and would love to help advance technology. Last semester I got straight As but sacrificed my social life for it, and now even when I try to make friends at school, nobody shares similar interests to myself or cares to pay any attention to me. Everyone else just cares about stuff I don't care about like drugs or video games, I want to get out and explore new things. I love action sports but I have lost interest recently due to both my depression and lack of friends to bike and skate with. I really need a girl in my life to help me, I have a more sensitive side that I'm showing now that needs to be vented. Ive only kissed or had a relationship with one girl ever and she cheated on me after two weeks. I am such a sincere and open-minded person and girls always turn me down, or claim to really like me a friend ( I'm fine with that) and later avoid me. Finally, I met an adorable girl recently who I connect with so well, but she only wanted to be friends, which I agreed to, yet now she always has a lame excuse to ignore me. I just feel lost and underappreciated ","I'm a 20 year old guy who struggles with bipolar depression.

"These past 4 days have been awful and I don't know what to do anymore. It all started on Thursday ( some context I'm 16) I got a call during school lunchtime that my best friend Jay(18) had been arrested for assault, he had beat his sister's  abusive boyfriend half to death so I'll probably never see him again but then an hour later I hear from my good friend John that my friend Mike(15) will be moving out of state because he got his girlfriend pregnant. Oh and not being able to see 2 of my friends wasn't enough I got pulled into the counselors office and told that I will be repeating earth science and that I will be taking a course over the summer. And on top of that my mom kicks me out of the house for 4 hours and I don't have a car so I get to bike in a rainstorm and when I'm finally allowed back in she tells me that I need to fuck off and stop being bad at school. It feels like my life is over and that I'm falling under and that I'm trapped if you have anything to say I'm all ears","These past 4 days have been awful and I don't know what to do anymore.

"Going through a tough time in my life. 37F. My husband of 2 years walked out on me a month ago and filed for divorce. No cheating or major issues, just differences in values.

I have a stepmother, but she and I have a very strained relationship and she is very critical of me and expresses her disapproval of how I do things all the time.  My father was my best friend. However, she's said a few things to me about how my father viewed me as having ""issues"".I have one brother, but we are not close. I do not have children.I have to wonder if there is something wrong with me. I feel I am the nicest person and quite easy to get along with. I have 4 excellent friends who are helping me hold everything together.I feel like I don't have anyone and I like I don't have any family.

"Im 7 months postpartum and having some trouble getting over PPD. Lots of crying lately and being overly sensitive to little things that wouldnt typically bother me. I guess just feeling pretty insecure personally. Also not feeling like myself- I used to do a lot alone like go to the mall, the movies, out to eat. I used to be very tidy and organized. I used to read and crochet. I do almost nothing that I did before I became a mom and now its like everything is about my son and if its not then I feel like a bad mom. Anyways, I just reached out to a girlfriend of mine and asked if she wouldnt mind going out for dinner so I could start trying to get out of the house. Would love some encouragement that this is a good step in the right direction because my heart is actually beating fast from embarrassment.","Im 7 months postpartum and having some trouble getting over PPD.

"Asking for help, whether it was in my childhood when i was weak and I knew that I would only want more, or now when I believe it creates a dependence, always ended up being angering or overbearing for the helper and I knew it whether they wanted to show it or not. and no-one wants to help a weakling or a arrogant person, so here I am waiting for myself to do something. perhaps just a word or two will do, because you cannot be me or care about me all the time and I know that, and I am not asking for that.

"A little background. I'm 36, male, 290lbs, and found out that I'm diabetic about a year and a half ago.  I'm still overweight and trying the Atkins diet now.  I have been recording my walks to track them to see if I'm improving on my time. Today I pushed myself a little bit harder and tracked a 14 minute and 17 seconds mile. So far that's my fastest mile pace. I was very proud of this achievement because it's been awhile since I've gotten under 15 minutes. Not really looking for any type of advice to make it better just a little bit of encouragement that I didn't receive when I got home. Thanks.","A little background.

I want to go into the film industry with the goal of being a screenwriter/director or possibly even an editor. Honestly I'm open to anything within the film industry if I enjoy it. I know it's a super hard field to go into but its the only thing that I have ever been passionate about in my life. I graduate from college in less than two years and have no clue what to do after. I'm thinking about moving to California but it scares me. I know that I have a big chance of failure but I also know that if I don't pursue this career that I will regret it for the rest of my life and will always think about the what if. I guess I'm just looking for somebody to say it'll be alright and don't give up. Thanks!,I want to go into the film industry with the goal of being a screenwriter/director or possibly even an editor.

"I'm an artist with original story ideas, many of them over 10 years old, but I've never been able to sit down and finish them. And that fact tends to extend to so many projects. I'm capable of doing so much art for others at huge speeds (commissions) and in that sense I'm super productive (multiple illustrations a day, even if rhey are small). I can easily sit down in the morning and producing art until before bed, but when it comes to my own stuff, it's almost impossible to just sit down and finish projects, be it an artbook, a plot, a comic, a game... I always end falling back into drawing commissions or illustrations, which I can finish with ease.It seems so many gamedevs or comic artists finished projects by the time they were my age or just a bit younger. Shouldn't I have projects behind me and not just illustrations by now? I'm getting closer to finishing stuff, but while I suffer of a quarter life crisis I fear I will just get old too fast to get it all out. It's a scary thought... I sure hope my capacity to produce become exponential with time or rejuvenation therapies become mainstream or something, because the stress is not going to help me make a better product either","I'm an artist with original story ideas, many of them over 10 years old, but I've never been able to sit down and finish them.

"Hi reddit, I'm in serious need of some encouragement words or some advice. Anything will do really. I'm not very good at this but let's give it a try.I'm 24, recently had to quit my job in order to finish my thesis and being able to get my fucking college degree. My Job was very stressful but it was my only source of income, I think I made the right decision by quitting but I'm in a tough spot right now.As you can imagine, working on a thesis is no easy feat and as of this moment I feel incredibly anxious, depressed and overwhelmed. I'm short of time and even shorter on motivation and willingness to live. I have no other income than my savings and I'm living with my parents.

"Hi Reddit! I could use some encouragement. My living situation is really weird right now. Three days/nights a week, I live in a small city for my master's program. During that time,  I live in a house with this random older woman (she's nice, but still random) and a roommate. It's comfortable enough, but def not my home and I always feel like a stranger/guest. The other three nights a week, I live with my fiance four hours north in an apartment that we don't love in a town we both hate (it's super rural, we miss our families &amp; friends in another state, etc). So, half the week I'm at school in a weird living situation, and the other half I'm with my fiance in a weird living situation. So, my car is kind of my home. I keep all my stuff in my car all the time (so yes, it's a mess). This arrangement will only last until Christmas break, so I have like 10 more weeks to go like this. This whole thing was my decision and done by my own hand, so I really have no right to complain, but it is still confusing and difficult. To make it all even more weird, one of my professors also hired me to house/dog sit a few nights a week, so I'll also be staying in a third house sometimes coming up. Anyone else ever lived out of their car, kinda? Please share any encouraging thoughts or ideas with me to get through this odd phase of my life!!! ","Hi Reddit! I could use some encouragement.

"Ive been on a downward spiralMy fianc and I have moved in together at the start of 2020, which either highlighted or exposed some major dependency issues that she has. On top of that, her mental health has been beyond terrible for herwhich is likely a huge driving force for the dependencyand Ive gotten Caregivers Fatigue 3 or 4 times already. I desperately want to communicate this issue but she can already read it off of me (been together for a long time) which is making her mental health worse at times, and I think if we were to outright have that conversation it would cause her mental health to be even worse. She also gets upset that it seems like I view her as helpless and unable to function without me, and admittedly I do because shes so extremely needyI hate myself physically. Literally from my head to my toes: I cant find a good haircut and the barber that I helped out with that couldnt be consistent, then COVID hit and Im out a barber &amp; reference point for my hair. Im in too low of a funk to consistently care about maintaining my beard which is as frustrating as daily care would be. Ive been gaining fat all of 2020 which not only do I want to lose weight but Im also a nutrition major so thats not a good look.","Ive been on a downward spiralMy fianc and I have moved in together at the start of 2020, which either highlighted or exposed some major dependency issues that she has.

Tension is in the air and I try to clear the tension to let him know that what he was looking at was junk e-mail. He refused to accept anything I was saying, so I left the apartment because I was getting upset."
"Hi, I'm pretty new here on Reddit. Anyway, I've been really sick for about a week now. Because of it, I've mostly been staying at home.My best friend regularly texts me from school and cheers me up. We have a really great relationship and almost never argue with each other)But today, she texted me out of nowhere, saying that ""I wish I were in your place"", and kept talking about how I had it easy and how stressed she was, unlike me.I was honestly really surprised, considering she knew how bad the pains from my illness are. I told her that my position is not perfect either and that I didn't wish her the pain I had. In the end she lashed out at me. I felt really bad and tried to apologize, but she is mostly ignoring me. I won't see her in person for another 3 days.I've been really stressed about this for the past few hours, and I can't help but feel guilty about it, even right now. With my self esteem and social anxiety issues, it is only getting worse. Can anyone please cheer me up a bit and give me some advice on how to properly apologize to her when I'll meet her again?Thanks in advance, and apologies for any mistakes in the post)","Hi, I'm pretty new here on Reddit.

"Yeah, of course I'm nervous. But I hope I can finally do it. And that's the important thing. Right? Is it gonna go well? Only time will tell. But hopefully with a bit of positivity I can work up the courage at the right moment. I'm gonna try to look at my phone a little before so hopefully what you guys say I see right before and don't back out, which unfortunately I've done before. Hope this works!","Yeah, of course I'm nervous. But I hope I can finally do it. And that's the important thing. Right? Is it gonna go well? Only time will tell.

"She was leading me on for a month and a half and I thought I was really getting somewhere. The fact that she tried to feel that way for me and couldnt made everything worse. I know this may sound irrational but I cant help feel that there is something wrong with me and that Im screwed up and thats why this happened to me. Every time I put myself out there I get hurt and this one was a huge blow to the gut. On top of all this, I had a falling out with one of my best friends and he turned some of my other friends against me. I just cant help but feel like everything bad that happens in my life is a direct result of my actions. I had no reason to think that the girl I was talking to would have liked me in the first place. We were barely friends before but after I asked for her number we got really close. She said the reason she doesnt want to make our relationship anything more is because she doesnt want to destroy the relationship we have right now. I dont know how true that actually is. I want to be friends with her but I dont know if she honestly values our friendship or if that is just a load of crap to make me feel better. I feel like Im a failure and I feel like I hurt everyone I'm involved with. If youve read all of this I appreciate it and any advice is appreciated","She was leading me on for a month and a half and I thought I was really getting somewhere.

"Blood everywhere. Its left a couple scars. Im lucky Im not blind.I dont want to tell you the whole story it would take a long time to recount all the details and a lot of it was just madness. I feel compelled to mention that I was begging my friends to get a gun and shoot me. I grabbed my friend by the hair and said terrible things to him (were no longer friends). The police came, and I was delirious but not combative, since I had collapsed. During the ambulance ride and for several hours afterwards I was hearing voices. My legs and arms were cuffed to a bed for the entire night. They position you in a certain uncomfortable position so you cant reach your hands close enough together to grab/use anything. I was so convinced that this was Hell, that I used my teeth to pull a cord coming from a nearby monitor and wrapped it around my neck to try to strangle myself.My sense of time became massively warped. It felt like I was in that hospital for 300 years. I eventually calmed down enough that they actually approved to release me.","Blood everywhere. Its left a couple scars.

"So, Ive been on this sub for a bit. There are probably people who have seen some of the encouragements I gave. Maybe you were even inspired by my encouragements.Well, today Im gonna need some of that.You see, I failed my last test. I thought I did very well on it but I actually got one of the lowest grades in the class.I talked to the professor about it and my professor asked if I was paying attention in class because he thought I might be multitasking. He told me some of the answers to the questions from the test were literally from the lecture. And he was right I was multitasking during lectures. Stupid of me right?I just feel like I cant recover from this. I feel like I cant pass this class. Im not even sure I can even finish my major.To sum it up, my confidence has been completely destroyed. I really struggle with believing myself.I was just wondering if any of you could help me.  Im not asking for much. A kind phrase will help. Maybe a bit of advice on how to navigate this class. Maybe a story of your own. Honestly anything helps.

"Im finishing up my first semester of my freshman year of college, Im majoring in premed. Right now its looking like Ill get somewhere between a 2.8-3.0 gpa at the end of the term, since I learned today that one of my classes (that I currently have an A in) only counts as a pass/fail class, and is not calculated into account for my gpa. That spiraled into a full blown panic attack, two hours of tears, and questioning whether or not I should shift my career focus. On top of that, Im out of state and need a 3.25 gpa by the end of the spring to maintain my scholarship. Both of my parents are now working full time to keep me here and I feel like Im letting them down. I dont know what to do. Im going to work my butt off on my finals but the fear of failure on top of my testing anxiety is freaking me out. My experience in high school did not prepare me for college whatsoever, and I dont want this to negatively impact the rest of my semesters here.

"Looks like the depression and disappointment hit me post midnight, as Im currently up at 5 am typing this. You know when only *one* small thing goes wrong then suddenly youre all up in a rut about every life decision youve made? Well, Im feeling really shitty about the fact that technically I allowed two things of my own possession to get slightly damaged, all in one night. Due to being lazy in bed, I asked my dad to shake my lava lamp to let the floating hardened liquid to sink towards the bottom. He shook it too hard, causing the whole thing to fall apart and for the lightbulb to lose one of its connector pieces. He said hed go to the hardware store soon to replace the lightbulb, but Im in slight doubt if the lamp will work after that, feeling that its my fault, in technical aspects. If I had simply gotten up to do it myself, then my lamp would have been fine. This is going to also sound ridiculous, but my new phone (no case, no screen protector) somehow slid off the surface I placed it on while doing something this late at night, causing it to hit the hard floor screen first, getting itself some small scratches on its corners in the process. I know the scratches arent that bad, but my obsessive compulsive disorder really tests my tolerance when it comes to the smallest things. And it was a new phone that Ive only had for a couple of weeks, for crying out loud! Why couldnt I have placed it on the floor or on the counter instead? Ive just been self deprecating for the past two hours, so far.In sum from all of this, how do I effectively diminish the thought of I could have done this to prevent this or that so I can learn from these small situations that have been bothering me for the past couple of hours? I guess I somehow have a compass as to how I can solve this, but hearing something from somebody else would really encourage me.","Looks like the depression and disappointment hit me post midnight, as Im currently up at 5 am typing this.

"I'm 31. I was diagnosed this Tuesday with prediabetes and high cholesterol. They put me on statins. I wasn't surprised. I'm 360lbs and 5'5.I have PCOS and my hormones have always been awful.

"Sorry for formatting or mistakes, im on my phone and currently crying in the bathroom over first year university calculus, i opened up a ""quiz"" (can be tried as many times until we've gotten over 75% to unlock the current weeks videos) and i just exited out because the first question had me stumped.  I havent done the homework yet, and I know that this isn't the way to go, i should havd done homework first to guage how well i know the material before stressing.  But I've had this mental block all day, and just this mental block in general that I can't actually be confident in my math skills.  And i always have this self doubt.  I just have thus idea that I can never be smart in all things math, I'm trying to have a growth mindset but its so hard.  I know that i have to put the work in to understanding math, and im going to try, but right after im done crying.  I just needed to say it as a stranger online since i don't have anyone to tell in real life, i dont want to put this all on my friends because I did that last night. And if im like this during the first year how will i handle the rest?During the summer i had the expectation that i would do better this year, but in already drained, I dont want to go throug mh 4 years of this.  If anyone has any advice, or comforting words or experience they could share, that would be nice.","Sorry for formatting or mistakes, im on my phone and currently crying in the bathroom over first year university calculus, i opened up a ""quiz"" (can be tried as many times until we've gotten over 75% to unlock the current weeks videos) and i just exited out because the first question had me stumped.

"Hey guys, this isn't something I would usually do but I could really use some encouragement, or even tough love. My ex of about 2 years dumped me about 2 weeks ago, just in time for semester break, great. The relationship didn't end badly, but it did end and I feel very unsatisfied about it. -  I can provide details and explain why if anyone is interested.Anyway, I'm back in my parent's house for break (2 more weeks), they live in a small town, and there's pretty much nothing to do. I don't drink, smoke, or do any drugs like most people do to pass the time around here. My best friend left back to the Army this morning, who knows when I'll get to see him again, and I don't really have much other friends around here. I find myself doing nothing but thinking about her and it really sucks; I'm miserable and sometimes the only thing that cheers me up is the thought that maybe she'll regret it one of these days, call me, and we'll get back together. However, today is the day she goes on vacation to mexico. She'll be surrounded by her supporting family all day for the next 2 weeks, I won't even be on her mind and it scares me; any realistic hope I had of us patching things up and getting back together begins to fade now, forever. I'm not completely distraught or taking it so bad that I'm thinking suicide, no way. But, it totally hurts; she's the first girlfriend I could say I sincerely loved.To get my mind off of her and just become a better man, I've committed to some changes in my life like reading every night, eating healthy, and working out. Those things have been helping but I still face a lot of downtime. I could really use some encouragement dudes and gals, and some suggestions on how to get over her or keep me busy in such a small town. Thank you :)","Hey guys, this isn't something I would usually do but I could really use some encouragement, or even tough love.

"I know my problems aren't worse than others. I know of all days today is definitely one of the easiest situations I've been put through in life. Today just hit me differently. I woke up really groggy and sleepy to get ready for work while worrying about my gf who has spine complications causing her endless pain. I tried to drive to work after pulling myself together but couldn't go because the road to get to my job was replaced by a ditch for construction.I have been raped, beaten by family, bullied most my life and jumped on multiple occasions. But today? Today feels so. Hard. I know I shouldn't be feeling sorry for myself but I really need a hand to be able to stand right now. I'm crying and have no idea why maybe it's just mood swings but everything feels awful and I don't know how to fix myself","I know my problems aren't worse than others.

Hes staying with his Mom house in my hometown, so were living apart. We probably need to move back to my hometown after a year living hours away since our support system is there and since thats where my husbands team of doctors is based. My mom just died in March and because Im a contractor for my current job, they didnt pay me for the whole week and a half of work that I was out. So moneys been tight. I had to replace my tires recently. Work hasnt paid me back for my travel expenses. Now Im job hunting again and looking for new places to live. Im pretty broke, I cant visit my husband because the drive is so far and challenging and I only have less than 48 hours to make the trip. Im dealing with the loss of my mom, and how Im so unavailable because of my job, but I cant take a break from it because I wont get paid for it. Plus Im just feeling so shitty and unhappy with my body and Im just struggling so much. I know Ill be ok, but like...its just been bad day after bad day. Im a very positive person and have been handling this well, but Im having a spiral moment. Advice, encouragement and positivity are welcome.

"Tried to go back to warehouse work but the pain in my legs, feet, hips and back was excruciating. Only lasted 3 months. Husband was the bread winner and I did literally everything else. All he had to do was bring home a check. I scheduled appointments, paid bills, cleaned the house, planned meals, grocery shopped, etc. I was already doing that while also working. It was nice to only do one side of it. We bought a house. 1 month later my husband lost his job of 7 years. In the 2 years since, he has worked a total of 5 months. We cashed out his 401k. It lasted a year. I tried another call center. Cried so they let me go. We don't have the money for food, but Im trying to eat right and exercise anyways. Husband refuses to work. He won't clean. He won't talk to me about our future. He won't get his driver's license. Still wants sex though, even though it's painful to me and I need to see a gyno. Im happy he still wants me. Im afraid he will stop one day. Im still doing everything.","Tried to go back to warehouse work but the pain in my legs, feet, hips and back was excruciating. Only lasted 3 months.

"We sat there talking about the possibilities for an hour straight.I got overwhelmed and needed to cool off in their bathroom. I was looking at myself in the mirror, and I could feel my brain pulsating and *moving*, like it was rewiring so rapidly that it was causing a physical sensation. Ive never felt anything like it.I suddenly felt enormous guilt. It was as if the universe was angry with me. I had opened Pandoras Box. I was this underaccomplished loser that barely achieved anything noteworthy in my life, always felt like a disappointment to my family, and here I had just stumbled across something that could change the world. I didnt deserve this, I hadnt worked for it at all, it was literally something I thought of while I was laying in bed after hitting the snooze button.That was the exact moment my psychotic break triggered. I became convinced that none of this was real. All an elaborate farce. My personal version of hell. I screamed and smashed my head against the mirror repeatedly. I had smashed through the medicine cabinet and wall behind it.","We sat there talking about the possibilities for an hour straight.I got overwhelmed and needed to cool off in their bathroom.

"So, Ive been on this sub for a bit. There are probably people who have seen some of the encouragements I gave. Maybe you were even inspired by my encouragements.Well, today Im gonna need some of that.You see, I failed my last test. I thought I did very well on it but I actually got one of the lowest grades in the class.I talked to the professor about it and my professor asked if I was paying attention in class because he thought I might be multitasking. He told me some of the answers to the questions from the test were literally from the lecture. And he was right I was multitasking during lectures. Stupid of me right?I just feel like I cant recover from this. I feel like I cant pass this class. Im not even sure I can even finish my major.To sum it up, my confidence has been completely destroyed. I really struggle with believing myself.I was just wondering if any of you could help me.  Im not asking for much. A kind phrase will help. Maybe a bit of advice on how to navigate this class. Maybe a story of your own. Honestly anything helps. Thanks in advance.","So, Ive been on this sub for a bit. There are probably people who have seen some of the encouragements I gave.

"Hi Reddit! I could use some encouragement. My living situation is really weird right now. Three days/nights a week, I live in a small city for my master's program. During that time,  I live in a house with this random older woman (she's nice, but still random) and a roommate. It's comfortable enough, but def not my home and I always feel like a stranger/guest. The other three nights a week, I live with my fiance four hours north in an apartment that we don't love in a town we both hate (it's super rural, we miss our families & friends in another state, etc). So, half the week I'm at school in a weird living situation, and the other half I'm with my fiance in a weird living situation. So, my car is kind of my home. I keep all my stuff in my car all the time (so yes, it's a mess). This arrangement will only last until Christmas break, so I have like 10 more weeks to go like this. This whole thing was my decision and done by my own hand, so I really have no right to complain, but it is still confusing and difficult. To make it all even more weird, one of my professors also hired me to house/dog sit a few nights a week, so I'll also be staying in a third house sometimes coming up. Anyone else ever lived out of their car, kinda? Please share any encouraging thoughts or ideas with me to get through this odd phase of my life!!! ","Hi Reddit! I could use some encouragement.

"I have struggled with Anxiety / depression since I was a teen and since the virus and being forced to quarantine I have lost most of my coping habits ( Gym, University, going to the beach, spending time with friends, seeing my therapist )   On top of that I have cut out of my life a close friend who was abusive, an Ex who came back for ill intentions, My half brother who was never there for me as kid, and i got rejected by a girl I've been crushing on for years.  All of this timing is so bad and every day the few things ive been able to do to take care of myself have been eating healthy, going a run, and doing a tiny bit of homework, as well as spending tons of time on the advice subreddit trying to help others.  I know i'll get through this, i know ill go back to being able to make myself happy without a need to feel complete from others. But Atm i am struggling with self care and my own self worth.

"These past 4 days have been awful and I don't know what to do anymore. It all started on Thursday ( some context I'm 16) I got a call during school lunchtime that my best friend Jay(18) had been arrested for assault, he had beat his sister's  abusive boyfriend half to death so I'll probably never see him again but then an hour later I hear from my good friend John that my friend Mike(15) will be moving out of state because he got his girlfriend pregnant. Oh and not being able to see 2 of my friends wasn't enough I got pulled into the counselors office and told that I will be repeating earth science and that I will be taking a course over the summer. And on top of that my mom kicks me out of the house for 4 hours and I don't have a car so I get to bike in a rainstorm and when I'm finally allowed back in she tells me that I need to fuck off and stop being bad at school. It feels like my life is over and that I'm falling under and that I'm trapped if you have anything to say I'm all ears","These past 4 days have been awful and I don't know what to do anymore.

"I failed my driver's test today. It is completely eating away at me, I feel so ashamed. I failed because I couldn't parallel park. I tried to practice beforehand but I didn't have a whole lot of time, it was all so rushed. I feel awful. I tried so hard and I feel like everyone is disappointed. When I mentioned it to people before hand I got ""it's super easy, you'll do great"" and then I failed and now I feel terrible. It seriously is making me sick rn. Everyone's response was just sorta ""oh that sucks"" The worst part about it is, I have made everything so much harder for my parents. They needed me to be an extra driver. And we're really tight right now but they paid the 50 bucks even though we were gonna have trouble affording it and I wasted it. I completely let them down and I feel sick to my stomach about it. They tried to hide it but I could tell that they were disappointed. I feel terrible. I've been beating myself up all day about it. I feel like an absolute failure. I worked so hard :(","I failed my driver's test today. It is completely eating away at me, I feel so ashamed. I failed because I couldn't parallel park. I tried to practice beforehand but I didn't have a whole lot of time, it was all so rushed. I feel awful. I tried so hard and I feel like everyone is disappointed. When I mentioned it to people before hand I got ""it's super easy, you'll do great"" and then I failed and now I feel terrible. It seriously is making me sick rn.

"I just finished packing my car by myself! I know its just a small part of moving but I dont know where else to go for encouragement with the little stuff. Both of my parents are out and about so I had to pack by myself, but it was nicer than expected. My (soon to be) roommate is already on the way and my boyfriend is on vacation without cell service, so I dont really have anyone to talk to. I hope everyone is having a great day :)","I just finished packing my car by myself! I know its just a small part of moving but I dont know where else to go for encouragement with the little stuff.

"I'm a 20 year old guy who struggles with bipolar depression. I attend college but honestly have no real clue what I wanna do with my life, I have a very strong interest in mathematics though and would love to help advance technology. Last semester I got straight As but sacrificed my social life for it, and now even when I try to make friends at school, nobody shares similar interests to myself or cares to pay any attention to me. Everyone else just cares about stuff I don't care about like drugs or video games, I want to get out and explore new things. I love action sports but I have lost interest recently due to both my depression and lack of friends to bike and skate with. I really need a girl in my life to help me, I have a more sensitive side that I'm showing now that needs to be vented. Ive only kissed or had a relationship with one girl ever and she cheated on me after two weeks. I am such a sincere and open-minded person and girls always turn me down, or claim to really like me a friend ( I'm fine with that) and later avoid me. Finally, I met an adorable girl recently who I connect with so well, but she only wanted to be friends, which I agreed to, yet now she always has a lame excuse to ignore me. I just feel lost and underappreciated ","I'm a 20 year old guy who struggles with bipolar depression.

"So Im not that chubby, I just have a little flab on my stomach that I want to get rid of. The way Im trying to lose it is by counting the calories of what I eat, and trying to eat a minimum of 1,200 calories per day. And thats all fine and dandy, but when I try to talk to my parents about what Im trying to do, they just keep on saying that Im trying to hard, and that I need to just eat when Im hungry.I really want to lose that flab, and having my parents not support me that much is a bit discouraging. Can anyone bring my motivation back a little bit? ","So Im not that chubby, I just have a little flab on my stomach that I want to get rid of.

"Acting positive. Being positive about my job even though it's gotten dire.I'm just angry, sad and lost. I don't have any friends here. My mother keeps telling me that I will find a better job, but I don't want to keep job hopping and getting paid even lower rates through waitress training when I know that an opportunity is just around the corner.I can't keep talking to my friends out of town about all of this. I hate when I get like this because I'm very draining when I'm this symptomatic. Some of them have stopped picking up the phone, which is understandable. I guess I'm just asking for any encouragement on this situation. I don't even know how to take my first step forward. I have been crying almost all of my waking hours since about 10pm last night. Any advice/encouragement for a mentally ill 35 year old who needs to start moving forward? I'm so tired. TL;DR: I'm 35, have a crappy job, but I'm working towards a better one. My brother said I could live with him and now I can't, less than 6 months in.","Acting positive. Being positive about my job even though it's gotten dire.I'm just angry, sad and lost.

"I just got back from a trip and I am miserable. I currently live in a town I dont like while waiting to go back to Uni. Its been a rough time and Im having a bad day. Feeling unproductive, sad, and wishing I was in school and not in this slow, boring town. I spend 9 hours a day on my phone. I am always in bed, watching boring tv shows. None of the non credit classes I wanted to take work for my schedule. I am in a transition with my job so my pay is less than it used to be. It sucks.Its also my mothers birthday and I dont want to be a party pooper at her B-Day dinner! So I could use some encouragement, toasting, and maybe even suggestions of stuff to do.","I just got back from a trip and I am miserable.

"Hi Reddit! I could use some encouragement. My living situation is really weird right now. Three days/nights a week, I live in a small city for my master's program. During that time,  I live in a house with this random older woman (she's nice, but still random) and a roommate. It's comfortable enough, but def not my home and I always feel like a stranger/guest. The other three nights a week, I live with my fiance four hours north in an apartment that we don't love in a town we both hate (it's super rural, we miss our families &amp; friends in another state, etc). So, half the week I'm at school in a weird living situation, and the other half I'm with my fiance in a weird living situation. So, my car is kind of my home. I keep all my stuff in my car all the time (so yes, it's a mess). This arrangement will only last until Christmas break, so I have like 10 more weeks to go like this. This whole thing was my decision and done by my own hand, so I really have no right to complain, but it is still confusing and difficult. To make it all even more weird, one of my professors also hired me to house/dog sit a few nights a week, so I'll also be staying in a third house sometimes coming up. Anyone else ever lived out of their car, kinda? Please share any encouraging thoughts or ideas with me to get through this odd phase of my life!!! ","Hi Reddit! I could use some encouragement.

I informed his mother of the situation and he proceeded to angrier with me.&amp;#x200B;Incident 6Partner and I are relaxing by the swimming pool and his phone is being used to play music. It starts to get late so I collect all of his belongings and try to turn his pandora off when I noticed his phone was accessible. I do the unthinkable and start looking through his phone. I only did this because early in the day he was acting very strangely and purposefully start arguments with me out of thin air. I ask him whats going on and he protests that nothing is the matter. We take pictures but I just have this gut feeling about him because he is starting issues with me for no apparent reason. I go through his phone and find him talking to TWO other females and making plans to visit them and talking about my son with them. I get enraged and start verbally attacking him as soon as I see him. I say everything possible that was on my mind and more all in front of his family.,I informed his mother of the situation and he proceeded to angrier with me.&amp;#x200B;Incident 6Partner and I are relaxing by the swimming pool and his phone is being used to play music.

"Hey,, i know it's usually people asking for advice around here, but i recently had a friend needing comfort when it came to talent,, and i think some people need to hear this,,,So, I'm 16. Not old, i know,, but I've seen more than most people at 20 have and im almost sure of it. I was raised in a very neglectful home,, and Im autistic, nonbinary and physically disabled to top it off. When i was younger, alot of my life was spent in isolation to avoid the sensory overloads or hate that came from being in public, along with the fact that i didn't fit in with anyone no matter where i went. My parents didn't bother to do much when it came to helping me,, only really talking to me if it had something to do with things they were angry with me about,,, so of course, i started wondering,, what is it that i dont have? Why does nobody anywhere like me? And i couldn't seem to figure it out,, no matter how hard i tried to be kinder, or to fit their needs, it only caused me greater pain. And then i got into drawing. Drawing was my first passion,, my first love,, until talent came along. I spent all my days alone, as usual, except this time was no longer spent in silence, sketching the plants and animals nearby, It was spent trying to build a talent. I spent hours and hours of time neglected by others, wripping up scraps of whatever paper i could find, crying for a talent. Something people would love me for, and something i could use to make people want to love me!","Hey,, i know it's usually people asking for advice around here, but i recently had a friend needing comfort when it came to talent,, and i think some people need to hear this,,,So, I'm 16.

Hello everyone!This is my first post on Reddit. I haven't been feeling too well lately I was throwing up and had a really low blood pressure due to anxiety ups and downs and I injured a part of my back on my birthday today and could hardly walk because of all the pain. Just felt kind of lonely since I have also had a hard time emotionally lately due to a lot of stress and don't really have friends or family like people that knew at all where I am and it's just raining the whole time lol. Still glad I have my bf with me :)Thanks everyone ,Hello everyone!This is my first post on Reddit.

"TW: breakdowns, phsyc hospitals, all that jazzi think i want to go to a phsyc ward (idk how to spell it) but i would have to admit all my feelings to my mom and tell her how i just chanted ""i want to die"" while in my bathroom. i could also probably use an evaluation cuz i don't like self diagnosing. also i would lose my baby siblings for a couple months and i LOVE them they are my world. not to mention all the school stuff i would miss. but i think this is a good idea and i want to go thru with it. can u guys hype me up?","TW: breakdowns, phsyc hospitals, all that jazzi think i want to go to a phsyc ward (idk how to spell it) but i would have to admit all my feelings to my mom and tell her how i just chanted ""i want to die"" while in my bathroom. i could also probably use an evaluation cuz i don't like self diagnosing. also i would lose my baby siblings for a couple months and i LOVE them they are my world. not to mention all the school stuff i would miss. but i think this is a good idea and i want to go thru with it. can u guys hype me up?"
"I just want this pain to end. I just cant find a reason to stay here in hell only waiting for the next woman to crush my heart.

"A little over a month ago I was tossed out of my apartment by my now ex-girlfriend.  I was sleeping on my friends couch for a week, and then my job asked me if I wanted to travel to another location temporarily.  Originally it was supposed to be 30 days, but I signed another 90 day commitment so my total time out will be 120 days.  It has just sunk in on me that I'm effectively homeless, living out of a hotel room with nowhere to go.  Fortunately my job put me in the hotel and are paying for it.  I just need someone to give me words of encouragement.","A little over a month ago I was tossed out of my apartment by my now ex-girlfriend.

"Hi Reddit! I could use some encouragement. My living situation is really weird right now. Three days/nights a week, I live in a small city for my master's program. During that time,  I live in a house with this random older woman (she's nice, but still random) and a roommate. It's comfortable enough, but def not my home and I always feel like a stranger/guest. The other three nights a week, I live with my fiance four hours north in an apartment that we don't love in a town we both hate (it's super rural, we miss our families &amp; friends in another state, etc). So, half the week I'm at school in a weird living situation, and the other half I'm with my fiance in a weird living situation. So, my car is kind of my home. I keep all my stuff in my car all the time (so yes, it's a mess). This arrangement will only last until Christmas break, so I have like 10 more weeks to go like this. This whole thing was my decision and done by my own hand, so I really have no right to complain, but it is still confusing and difficult. To make it all even more weird, one of my professors also hired me to house/dog sit a few nights a week, so I'll also be staying in a third house sometimes coming up. Anyone else ever lived out of their car, kinda? Please share any encouraging thoughts or ideas with me to get through this odd phase of my life!!! ","Hi Reddit! I could use some encouragement.

I could just buy the cannoli and cut all this out, but tracking down the recipes and making them has and will help with the anxiety about giving them to her.

"Ive had some rough years before, or so I thought. 2018 has been a horrible year for my mental health. I dont know what happened, but Ive developed a seemingly unshakable hatred for my physical appearance, constantly nitpicking and tearing apart everything about myself. I recently had to decide to take a few steps away from alcohol, for a time, because Ive developed a tendency to use it as an escape from confronting any real issues I have, emotionally. Im staying up until 5 AM, Sleeping in until 3 PM, and staying inside with little to no motivation to do anything but shut myself away in my room and wait until I can sleep again.Theres something in me that refuses to believe my friends want to stay close, and something worse still that is agitated by the people who clearly show it. I know Im young, Im under no delusions that Im fully mature and that this is it, but I cant shake this feeling that Ill NEVER shake this. I have goals and dreams that I am actively sabotaging, and I need to stop. Its a lot to ask, I know, but could anyone offer some advice, or words of encouragement? Right now the idea that Ill fix myself up just seems completely alien to me.","Ive had some rough years before, or so I thought. 2018 has been a horrible year for my mental health. I dont know what happened, but Ive developed a seemingly unshakable hatred for my physical appearance, constantly nitpicking and tearing apart everything about myself. I recently had to decide to take a few steps away from alcohol, for a time, because Ive developed a tendency to use it as an escape from confronting any real issues I have, emotionally. Im staying up until 5 AM, Sleeping in until 3 PM, and staying inside with little to no motivation to do anything but shut myself away in my room and wait until I can sleep again.Theres something in me that refuses to believe my friends want to stay close, and something worse still that is agitated by the people who clearly show it.

"Mum but she gives up and at this point the belittling, the constant hassle, and being told I WAS good enough but now Im not isnt really making me any happier than I was before, hes making my life to be hell and he even said he is when I confronted him, because of my choice that I didnt want a career its ruined his low level pride and Im the one to blame cause he didnt make a thing good of his life otherwise.","Mum but she gives up and at this point the belittling, the constant hassle, and being told I WAS good enough but now Im not isnt really making me any happier than I was before, hes making my life to be hell and he even said he is when I confronted him, because of my choice that I didnt want a career its ruined his low level pride and Im the one to blame cause he didnt make a thing good of his life otherwise."
"Acting positive. Being positive about my job even though it's gotten dire.I'm just angry, sad and lost. I don't have any friends here. My mother keeps telling me that I will find a better job, but I don't want to keep job hopping and getting paid even lower rates through waitress training when I know that an opportunity is just around the corner.I can't keep talking to my friends out of town about all of this. I hate when I get like this because I'm very draining when I'm this symptomatic. Some of them have stopped picking up the phone, which is understandable. I guess I'm just asking for any encouragement on this situation. I don't even know how to take my first step forward. I have been crying almost all of my waking hours since about 10pm last night. Any advice/encouragement for a mentally ill 35 year old who needs to start moving forward? I'm so tired. TL;DR: I'm 35, have a crappy job, but I'm working towards a better one. My brother said I could live with him and now I can't, less than 6 months in.","Acting positive. Being positive about my job even though it's gotten dire.I'm just angry, sad and lost.

"My wife and I recently moved to be closer to her family to help with childcare. I was making $40,000+/yr at a restaurant.  I've worked in restaurants most of my life and have truly come to hate it. So with the move, I decided to try to do something different.  So I got a job in a completely different industry and now only make $15.50/ hr, about $30,000/yr. My wife just got a job making $13/hr.  I'm struggling seeing us making enough money to obtain our goals. We are currently living with her parents. We have two kids and the oldest will be starting preschool in a year or two. We still need to get another car for myself that's big enough for all four of us.  And we really want to start thinking about buying our first house instead of renting. Are we going to be OK? Can someone just call me crazy and say it's going to work out?My wife's reaction was to start yelling that this is why she hates being with me.  Nothing is ever good enough for me and I'm incredibly hard on my self because I want to be and to give my kids everything I didn't have.

Hello everyone!This is my first post on Reddit. I haven't been feeling too well lately I was throwing up and had a really low blood pressure due to anxiety ups and downs and I injured a part of my back on my birthday today and could hardly walk because of all the pain. Just felt kind of lonely since I have also had a hard time emotionally lately due to a lot of stress and don't really have friends or family like people that knew at all where I am and it's just raining the whole time lol. Still glad I have my bf with me :)Thanks everyone ,Hello everyone!This is my first post on Reddit.

"I just want this pain to end. I just cant find a reason to stay here in hell only waiting for the next woman to crush my heart. There is such a deep pain in my chest, it hurts each time my heart takes a beat. My soul is wounded and bleeding.Give me some reasons if you can, something that makes me believe there can be a future, or just tell me I am worthless, pathetic man and shouldnt be wasting everyone's air. I feel pathetic doing this but part of me, a slim part, but a part does want to see something past the pain, it is just a small dot of light in a very dark room. I am just a weak man who has to much emotion in his soul and his heart has died again.Look in my history, I wrote something last night, but I did not do it, though I could see myself doing it and even I would admit that I wanted to.

"So...Today I was planning on giving myself a pizza birthday with anyone who wanted to join on my campus. I only have two friends. I got a check for $100 yesterday that I cashed and I have been looking forward to this all week. Even after my birthday that happened this past Wednesday. I had some bills to pay like hulu and neflix which I didn't mind. But i made sure that I was saving enough to I could buy the stuff. I got on the bus. Got some drinks for myself and I got two bracelets from hot topic too but what I didn't realize was that most of my billing stuff happened today. So I went from $60 to $8 cause I didn't know my netflix bill and hulu bill happened today. So after I bought drinks and two cool bracelets for myself, I didn't have enough money to buy my pizzas. I was at target and I had put two digornio's stuffed cheese pizzas in my cart and I was trying to check my bank finances cause I always get paranoid that money is going to disappear. But I had $40 after I bought my bracelets.","So...Today I was planning on giving myself a pizza birthday with anyone who wanted to join on my campus. I only have two friends.

But I feel especially down at work, more than I ever did while serving in the previous years.

"I have a shitty job and a very unsupportive family. While having dinner, I told them about my plans to leave my full time job and build my own career on freelancing.

Ive also saved enough money to live for a year which Im confident that Ill be able to get clients by then. It just hurts to know that none of the people I consider the closest to me support me in what I want to do. Its seriously taking a toll to my mental health. Ive been wanting to do this since last year but I just didnt have the right skills and financial stability yet. Now I know Im ready but it feels like its dragging me down with all the doubt that my family has around me. I easily get affected by what other people tell me which sucks big time.

But I had $40 after I bought my bracelets.","So...Today I was planning on giving myself a pizza birthday with anyone who wanted to join on my campus. I only have two friends. I got a check for $100 yesterday that I cashed and I have been looking forward to this all week. Even after my birthday that happened this past Wednesday. I had some bills to pay like hulu and neflix which I didn't mind. But i made sure that I was saving enough to I could buy the stuff. I got on the bus. Got some drinks for myself and I got two bracelets from hot topic too but what I didn't realize was that most of my billing stuff happened today.

"I have struggled with Anxiety / depression since I was a teen and since the virus and being forced to quarantine I have lost most of my coping habits ( Gym, University, going to the beach, spending time with friends, seeing my therapist )   On top of that I have cut out of my life a close friend who was abusive, an Ex who came back for ill intentions, My half brother who was never there for me as kid, and i got rejected by a girl I've been crushing on for years.  All of this timing is so bad and every day the few things ive been able to do to take care of myself have been eating healthy, going a run, and doing a tiny bit of homework, as well as spending tons of time on the advice subreddit trying to help others.  I know i'll get through this, i know ill go back to being able to make myself happy without a need to feel complete from others. But Atm i am struggling with self care and my own self worth.

"Hey everyone,I am feeling really overwhelmed, and I wasn't sure where else to turn. My long-term boyfriend left me a few days ago completely unexpectedly, the day before Thanksgiving. We share a house, a dog and two cats. I wouldn't have committed to all of those things if I didn't think he was in it for the long haul. We just renewed our least last month.I have finals for grad school this weekend and next. It's a really hard program that I'm struggling with right now. I need to get an A on one of my finals or I will get kicked out (the program requires above an 85 in all classes and I did really poorly on the midterm).I haven't had time to study. I am so stressed. I can't afford the house on my own, so I have been scrambling for an apartment. I think I found one that I can move to next Monday. I am taking my dog and one of our cats. I feel horrible for them. Do you think they know and are sad?I started a new job (with my same company, but a lot more responsibilities) two weeks ago. I just started a new medication (Zoloft) last week before the breakup happened. There is so much happening and I don't know what emotions are caused by the breakup...or the medicine...or school or the job.I know it will get better...but how can I be ok enough now to focus on school and work? I feel so sad and scared and I'm just really struggling, but I don't want to give up now. I'm sorry that I'm complaining so much. I know I am very fortunate in many ways. I wish I could just focus on that and let go of all of the pain I am feeling.Thank you.","Hey everyone,I am feeling really overwhelmed, and I wasn't sure where else to turn.

"I've been reading some things on Reddit that have re-activated my fears of never getting a partner. It's like a massive weightful dread and sadness that I don't know what to do with. I looked up and found this subreddit because I feel like a withered plant who never got any masculine encouragement to try different risky things and take action despite fears, including talking to girls. And I feel starved for female attention as well, which creates a self-perpetuating cycle. I would love if I had men and women in my life who supported me with approaching people socially, either for romantic purposes or just trying crazy things. But most of the people around me seem anxious and not to know how to provide that sounding board. They wouldn't tell me to jump off a waterfall if it was actually safe and I was just scared.Another thing I could use encouragement on is a large project of mine, which I don't know how to start, because much of it requires social buy-in from others to get going. But also, in order for it to get going, it needs social buy-in. So I probably need to wait until I have more resources, but then there's this voice in my head saying ""why wait?"". So it's frustrating.","I've been reading some things on Reddit that have re-activated my fears of never getting a partner.

I looked up and found this subreddit because I feel like a withered plant who never got any masculine encouragement to try different risky things and take action despite fears, including talking to girls. And I feel starved for female attention as well, which creates a self-perpetuating cycle. I would love if I had men and women in my life who supported me with approaching people socially, either for romantic purposes or just trying crazy things. But most of the people around me seem anxious and not to know how to provide that sounding board. They wouldn't tell me to jump off a waterfall if it was actually safe and I was just scared.Another thing I could use encouragement on is a large project of mine, which I don't know how to start, because much of it requires social buy-in from others to get going. But also, in order for it to get going, it needs social buy-in. So I probably need to wait until I have more resources, but then there's this voice in my head saying ""why wait?"". So it's frustrating."
"I could use some encouragement! I am stepping into an important role at work where I have chosen to hold my bosses accountable for their poor health and safety approach. Because they have so poorly treated staff previously, many of the same peers who used to complain with me about our managers are now stepping back and conveniently avoiding me at work. I feel resentful, hurt, and abandoned; even though I know shouldn't. It's a hard job that takes a toll on one's mental and physical health. I can't blame them for not wanting to put more energy into such a place. That's where you come in I guess! I just need some ""atta boys!"".","I could use some encouragement!

On top of that, her mental health has been beyond terrible for herwhich is likely a huge driving force for the dependencyand Ive gotten Caregivers Fatigue 3 or 4 times already. I desperately want to communicate this issue but she can already read it off of me (been together for a long time) which is making her mental health worse at times, and I think if we were to outright have that conversation it would cause her mental health to be even worse. She also gets upset that it seems like I view her as helpless and unable to function without me, and admittedly I do because shes so extremely needyI hate myself physically. Literally from my head to my toes: I cant find a good haircut and the barber that I helped out with that couldnt be consistent, then COVID hit and Im out a barber &amp; reference point for my hair. Im in too low of a funk to consistently care about maintaining my beard which is as frustrating as daily care would be.

If anyone has any advice, or comforting words or experience they could share, that would be nice."
"I was always criticized by my foster dad growing up. I learned that sharing my ideas, interests and hobbies will always been seen as weird. It's made me struggle with talking to new people and even made me fearful for thinking about making friends. I have accepted the fact that I am seen as weird and that has made me socially anxious to make friends. I can't even look at a person in the eyes without thinking I look weird. I've grew up going through certain events that made me shut myself off from the world and be ashamed to share my interests and not know who I really am. I'm going to be 29 this week....And I feel like I have learned about things in life so late and that that makes me so under developed. I know though that I will get over it and that I will learn to accept myself and find out how I am but trying to break a pattern you have been dealing with for 27 years is the hardest thing I am going through.","I was always criticized by my foster dad growing up.

"I failed the first 2 times, but now Im feeling a lot more confident.There was a huge difference between my first and my second test, but I was still a few mistakes off from passing. However, the difference now is that Ive also been driving with my dad in a pretty big parking lot, which was actually a few smaller parking lots connected by lots of streets.It had most of the obstacles Id find in the city, although the traffic was almost non existent.Ive driven through the city a lot as well and I learned to be a lot more confident in my driving.Im also a lot more cautious, which would have helped with a few small mistakes I made.I am confident Ill pass now, but I was also confident Id pass before, and thats scary.","I failed the first 2 times, but now Im feeling a lot more confident.There was a huge difference between my first and my second test, but I was still a few mistakes off from passing.

"So...Today I was planning on giving myself a pizza birthday with anyone who wanted to join on my campus. I only have two friends. I got a check for $100 yesterday that I cashed and I have been looking forward to this all week. Even after my birthday that happened this past Wednesday. I had some bills to pay like hulu and neflix which I didn't mind. But i made sure that I was saving enough to I could buy the stuff. I got on the bus. Got some drinks for myself and I got two bracelets from hot topic too but what I didn't realize was that most of my billing stuff happened today. So I went from $60 to $8 cause I didn't know my netflix bill and hulu bill happened today. So after I bought drinks and two cool bracelets for myself, I didn't have enough money to buy my pizzas. I was at target and I had put two digornio's stuffed cheese pizzas in my cart and I was trying to check my bank finances cause I always get paranoid that money is going to disappear. But I had $40 after I bought my bracelets.","So...Today I was planning on giving myself a pizza birthday with anyone who wanted to join on my campus. I only have two friends.

"Hey guys. So Ive been struggling a lot with self-esteem when it comes to my looks. Ive had the same haircut since like 4th grade  (10th grade now) and get teased about it. About a month ago I tried something new, only to be made fun of for that. I ended up reverting back to my old hairstyle. Today i got a haircut (just shortened my hair, didnt change the style) and, once again I was made fun of, even by an adult coworker. I have acne pretty bad, and regardless of what I try its just inexorable. My ears stick out super far, and the young kids I work with say I look like an elf. I have major bags under my eyes due to a type of insomnia, and my face is unsymmetrical when I examine it.At this point its just a struggle to deal with all these things. Im fairly popular but still face social anxiety, especially when talking to girls, due to my low opinion of my looks. I could really use some encouragement. Any and all is welcome. Thanks guys :)","Hey guys. So Ive been struggling a lot with self-esteem when it comes to my looks. Ive had the same haircut since like 4th grade  (10th grade now) and get teased about it.

"In that picture she looked so happy, I had proposed to her that night and she was showing off the ring. It was the happiest moment in my life, I told her I didnt want anyone else in my life only her and her daughter. We could all be happy together. I would treat her daughter like she was my own, because she was part of her mother and I loved her mother completely. She said she was headed that direction with me too, and I felt like that was a yes to my question.I am not doing good right now, I am off my med schedule for days now, not eating, not sleeping, and drinking to much. All bad things for me. I am so tired, I wish I could just sleep and not see her there, not see our time together, not spend time at the park playing on the equipment with her daughter. Not holding her in my arms.","In that picture she looked so happy, I had proposed to her that night and she was showing off the ring.

"Just need a little encouragement. A man threatened suicide when I told him I no longer wanted to date. I helped him get help and when I thought the situation deescalated, I left. He since has sent numerous texts and emails. Finally (much, much later when I thought this was over) he sent a 4-page letter to my house claiming that I caused all of the anxiety, depression, and desire to end it all. I filed a PFA (protection from abuse) against him. He is an abuser and its going to take a lot to be in the same room as him tomorrow - and to listen to him make up his version of reality, and to fight the protection I am seeking.I am hoping against hope that the judge believes me and is willing to grant this order to give me some peace of mind.UPDATE: abuser tried to outright lie and say I kept coming to his building so HE now wanted an order against ME. My incredible lawyer was not having any of that - and I was granted the order. Thank you everyone for your encouragement. I am so relieved","Just need a little encouragement.

"These past 4 days have been awful and I don't know what to do anymore. It all started on Thursday ( some context I'm 16) I got a call during school lunchtime that my best friend Jay(18) had been arrested for assault, he had beat his sister's  abusive boyfriend half to death so I'll probably never see him again but then an hour later I hear from my good friend John that my friend Mike(15) will be moving out of state because he got his girlfriend pregnant. Oh and not being able to see 2 of my friends wasn't enough I got pulled into the counselors office and told that I will be repeating earth science and that I will be taking a course over the summer. And on top of that my mom kicks me out of the house for 4 hours and I don't have a car so I get to bike in a rainstorm and when I'm finally allowed back in she tells me that I need to fuck off and stop being bad at school. It feels like my life is over and that I'm falling under and that I'm trapped if you have anything to say I'm all ears","These past 4 days have been awful and I don't know what to do anymore.

Im tired, I feel weak, Im scared, and I feel alone even though I know Im not. I dont know why I feel this way. I have to fight to find the motivation to get out of bed every morning."

"Arguing with me over not answering his phone calls when he thought I should, questioning my whereabouts and who I was hanging out with, and arguing with me about how I was disrespectful to him because I made a sarcastic joke or telling me that my facial expressions and tone of voice was disrespecting him, he would blow this out of proportion and make it seem like I'm antagonizing him, when I was just responding to a question he was asking. I asked him how was my tone and he couldn't tell me.&amp;#x200B;The recent dispute happened when I told him he could not have $1000 from my refund check. I did tell him yes earlier in the month, but after thinking and reconsidering his actions and everything that I have endured like paying for daycare for the past 3 months, and finding out he was going to party instead of working like he told me, I decided that I was not handing over any money to him. I cautioned myself and explained to him, I can't give the $1000 because I do not have means to do so right now. He went ballistic and basically told me that I put him in debt by throwing him in jail and after all the things he has done for me--I can't help him out.

"Currently I am working my way through reading the kindle version of Ray Dalio's Principles: Life and Work, while listening to the audiobook of it to keep me going. Which has been great because I haven't managed to read a book in almost a decade. Not to mention having to make the time to listen to an audiobook given how crammed my schedule is, since I also do my best to make time to spend with my girlfriend. It's also really nice to know that my girlfriend and I are in this together.I'm just trying to remind myself how far I have come, and how I'm right on the cusp of the rest of my life. I'm looking forward to moving out from my parents' house and in with my girlfriend into our own place in the coming months hopefully. As well as generating an income of my own from my own projects and generating an income from trading on the stock market.","Currently I am working my way through reading the kindle version of Ray Dalio's Principles: Life and Work, while listening to the audiobook of it to keep me going.

"Ive had some rough years before, or so I thought. 2018 has been a horrible year for my mental health. I dont know what happened, but Ive developed a seemingly unshakable hatred for my physical appearance, constantly nitpicking and tearing apart everything about myself. I recently had to decide to take a few steps away from alcohol, for a time, because Ive developed a tendency to use it as an escape from confronting any real issues I have, emotionally. Im staying up until 5 AM, Sleeping in until 3 PM, and staying inside with little to no motivation to do anything but shut myself away in my room and wait until I can sleep again.Theres something in me that refuses to believe my friends want to stay close, and something worse still that is agitated by the people who clearly show it. I know Im young, Im under no delusions that Im fully mature and that this is it, but I cant shake this feeling that Ill NEVER shake this. I have goals and dreams that I am actively sabotaging, and I need to stop. Its a lot to ask, I know, but could anyone offer some advice, or words of encouragement? Right now the idea that Ill fix myself up just seems completely alien to me.","Ive had some rough years before, or so I thought. 2018 has been a horrible year for my mental health.

It took me awhile to figure this out but i have a fear of things working out too well for me due to superstitions (like it falling apart ) or just doing so well that i have responsibilities that i cant handle. And it holds me back SO much that i dont wanna leave my comfort zone of doing the same boring things every day even though i hate it so much..Some encouragement or advice would be wonderful:) thanks in advance,It took me awhile to figure this out but i have a fear of things working out too well for me due to superstitions (like it falling apart ) or just doing so well that i have responsibilities that i cant handle.

"I'm an artist with original story ideas, many of them over 10 years old, but I've never been able to sit down and finish them. And that fact tends to extend to so many projects. I'm capable of doing so much art for others at huge speeds (commissions) and in that sense I'm super productive (multiple illustrations a day, even if rhey are small). I can easily sit down in the morning and producing art until before bed, but when it comes to my own stuff, it's almost impossible to just sit down and finish projects, be it an artbook, a plot, a comic, a game... I always end falling back into drawing commissions or illustrations, which I can finish with ease.It seems so many gamedevs or comic artists finished projects by the time they were my age or just a bit younger. Shouldn't I have projects behind me and not just illustrations by now? I'm getting closer to finishing stuff, but while I suffer of a quarter life crisis I fear I will just get old too fast to get it all out. It's a scary thought... I sure hope my capacity to produce become exponential with time or rejuvenation therapies become mainstream or something, because the stress is not going to help me make a better product either","I'm an artist with original story ideas, many of them over 10 years old, but I've never been able to sit down and finish them.

Hello everyone!This is my first post on Reddit. I haven't been feeling too well lately I was throwing up and had a really low blood pressure due to anxiety ups and downs and I injured a part of my back on my birthday today and could hardly walk because of all the pain. Just felt kind of lonely since I have also had a hard time emotionally lately due to a lot of stress and don't really have friends or family like people that knew at all where I am and it's just raining the whole time lol. Still glad I have my bf with me :)Thanks everyone ,Hello everyone!This is my first post on Reddit.

"Blood everywhere. Its left a couple scars. Im lucky Im not blind.I dont want to tell you the whole story it would take a long time to recount all the details and a lot of it was just madness. I feel compelled to mention that I was begging my friends to get a gun and shoot me. I grabbed my friend by the hair and said terrible things to him (were no longer friends). The police came, and I was delirious but not combative, since I had collapsed. During the ambulance ride and for several hours afterwards I was hearing voices. My legs and arms were cuffed to a bed for the entire night. They position you in a certain uncomfortable position so you cant reach your hands close enough together to grab/use anything. I was so convinced that this was Hell, that I used my teeth to pull a cord coming from a nearby monitor and wrapped it around my neck to try to strangle myself.My sense of time became massively warped. It felt like I was in that hospital for 300 years. I eventually calmed down enough that they actually approved to release me.","Blood everywhere. Its left a couple scars.

"So I need help, I've been through quite a lot lately. Going to NC with my controlling family, and from that I was depressed for months and my wonderful bf was there for me and encouraging. Ive been struggling with positivity and it's like my brain just doesn't know how to change a sentence to not be demeaning. Is there a good book on encouraging because I want to have his back and he shouldn't have to give everything to lift me up, I just wish I was better at lifting him up. A small example that we had a fight over. He got a gym membership and I'm allowed to be his guest, it was great until he got tired of going and I was encouraging enough to get him there. He wishes I just told him when we would go because I can't get in without him. He was mad at me because he said that he got us to the gym and I didn't do anything to keep us there. But he also hates this gym and works alot so it's not like I want to force him, I want him to be on board. This is mostly rambling but anything that anyone can do would be most grateful. I love him so much and he deserves better support.","So I need help, I've been through quite a lot lately.

Im afraid that I wont be accepted or that people will treat me differently or like Im not normal if I do open up about this which is why Im deciding to ask a bunch of internet strangers in another sub that is more suited to my issue (sorry guys but this just isnt the right place for THAT encouragement) I really just need to be encouraged that it is ok to open up and dive into this self exploration.

I gotta wake up real early tomorrow for my drivers permit test at the DMV.

About to go take my first driving test here in an hour. I dont really have anyone to talk about this with so I figured Id make something here.

"Ok so I'm pretty freaked out right now. Both because this is my first time posting, and because today I posted my first (and very rough) YT video.Some context: I live away from my family, they're in Indonesia and I'm in Sydney. I visit every year for Xmas, but this time it got sadder to go back to work after the holidays. I realised that I'd usually keep my head down at work for a whole year, and it started to feel sad and pointless. When I met up with a close friend while I was home, we talked about what really makes you feel happy, and singing is something that came up for as I felt it was like an outlet. The issue is that I feel like I can never compare, so I never tried.For a long time I knew and felt that my voice isn't great, and especially not the kind that would make your head turn and go - whoa that person can sing!I never realise how it really stopped me from doing a lot of things - like trying at all. Or practising, because I completely ruled myself out.I never uploaded Youtube videos cause I always thought that I just wouldn't compare, so don't try.","Ok so I'm pretty freaked out right now.

"Ive been on a downward spiralMy fianc and I have moved in together at the start of 2020, which either highlighted or exposed some major dependency issues that she has. On top of that, her mental health has been beyond terrible for herwhich is likely a huge driving force for the dependencyand Ive gotten Caregivers Fatigue 3 or 4 times already. I desperately want to communicate this issue but she can already read it off of me (been together for a long time) which is making her mental health worse at times, and I think if we were to outright have that conversation it would cause her mental health to be even worse. She also gets upset that it seems like I view her as helpless and unable to function without me, and admittedly I do because shes so extremely needyI hate myself physically. Literally from my head to my toes: I cant find a good haircut and the barber that I helped out with that couldnt be consistent, then COVID hit and Im out a barber & reference point for my hair. Im in too low of a funk to consistently care about maintaining my beard which is as frustrating as daily care would be. Ive been gaining fat all of 2020 which not only do I want to lose weight but Im also a nutrition major so thats not a good look.","Ive been on a downward spiralMy fianc and I have moved in together at the start of 2020, which either highlighted or exposed some major dependency issues that she has.

My boyfriend has been checked out and does not seem to want me anymore. He offers to do nice things but no more saying I love you and seems really checked out. It's super difficult trying to talk to him. He was the first person I've loved and now it looks like things won't work out. My boss (I am a nurse) has treated us horribly during this pandemic. Does not care if we are safe and gets after us if we wear masks around unscreened patients. Administration backs them up. All them are working safely from home. My old boss said she is posting a better position for me soon. I hope she does. If not i may need to do travel nursing. I have gained so much weight from school and from working nights. I am so exhausted (I am in grad school FT now and am working) and don't run and work out like i should. My new job will be better and I'll be able to workout more. I am not as attractive and thin as I used to be and I can tell by the way guys are around me then vs now. It's depressing. I've always struggled with weight. Things are tough and i know they will get better. It's life. I could use some encouragement though.,My boyfriend has been checked out and does not seem to want me anymore.

"I joined a discord server awhile ago that has a couple of my friends. This server also has their friends, and one of them is a jerk. I was just in a huge argument with him.

The thought itself is nerve-wracking for me.Early this year, I created a YT channel where I can start first by making covers before posting my own-----except that I am still too nervous to share it with others. There are a few views but from strangers, so it makes me less anxious that people do not know it is me. Just now, I did try sharing it with a few friends, who are still yet to respond. In the meantime, it's making my stomach churn.Generally, I think I am just scared of disappointing them.I know I need to let others hear my outputs because I need feedback to improve and grow.

"I've got my recipes and all my ingredients, but my brain (Which is very good at self-sabotage) has come up with an outcome I'm having trouble dealing with. Putting aside the anxiety I'm feeling about just giving them to her, I'm utterly *terrified* she's going to think this is some kind of assholish passive-aggressive one-upmanship because I'm making the cannoli rather than buying it like she did with the cheesecake. I could just buy the cannoli and cut all this out, but tracking down the recipes and making them has and will help with the anxiety about giving them to her. I also feel the situation calls for the extra effort. I'll most likely say this when I give them to her, but that doesn't make the thought go away or the whole thing any less daunting.So have at me r/encouragement.

I broke down and started ugly crying in front of the prosecutor. it was so frustrating. I went to rehab in april.

I got a new job, but I had to quit because the dish guy was harassing me. it got to the point where I was terrified to go into work and all they told me was to just leave him alone. so I quit. every time something good happens 10 bad things happen. I wrecked my car and I have a rental car now, but whatever money the insurance gives me my dad is just gonna use to pay off the car that I wrecked. so getting a new car is on me and I have no money. no job. im getting really fucking tired of this shit. all my friends do drugs so I pretty much lost all of them when I got out of rehab. ive stayed clean for the most part, ive only drank and smoked weed a handful of times. i has a job interview today but I couldnt go because I didnt have enough gas in my car. i just want a fucking break.","im 19, ive been arrested twice for marijuana. once when I was 17 and then again when I was 18, it was over a year ago and im still going to court for it. yesterday I sat in the court room for almost 5 hours just for them to give me another court date.

"I had to pull over in a parking lot because it was too dangerous to continue to drive. At the time, my car did not have AC and I had my son in the backseat taking him to daycare. I call my partner to inform him that I needed his help because my car was disabled. He asked me to drop a pin at my location and I did but it gave the incorrect address, so I gave him the actual address of where I was. Instead of coming to get me, he started to rant about not wanting to be on the road searching for me. I get irritated and curse at him and from then on he argued me to death about he is doing me a favor and that I shouldn't be talking to people in a certain way when I need something. He continued to refuse to come and get me and instructed me to find someone else to pick me up. When I did, he got upset that I even asked him and proceeded to argue with me for the rest of the day. During the arguments he stated that he wish he never met me and had a baby with me and stated that he wished his son was dead.","I had to pull over in a parking lot because it was too dangerous to continue to drive.

So my friend and I have known each for a long time and my friend lives across the country hes the same age as me and overreacts at everything when we talk and play with each other I say something offensive that was meant to be a joke he takes it seriously and now because I was being insecure about who I really am he cant trust me I share almost everything with him but...now Im not sure if he wants to stay friends..I care deeply about my friend and would never want to hurt him but i dont know what to do anymore and thats not even Half the shit I feel Im 14 years old and I have had anxiety attacks on and off day in and day out my family isnt that great and I keep everything from them even tho I shouldnt but when I do try to open up they try to help but instead make it worse I dont shit.i know people think that Im just a little girl and know nothing about life or love or pain but Im hurt and I have no one else to talk to...I came here because I needed to rant but looking back on these things that I say I feel worthless and Pitiful and ashamed...I used to cut my thighs thinking it was going to make me feel better and it did for a while but then it didnt and I started cutting harder and deeper making myself bleed and my thighs werent enough so I cut my wrists and told myself to hide them one day I was so depressed and felt almost nothing emotionally that I tried planning my death and when I was going to do it.,so I know nobody will probably see this but Im going to rant sorry if you came here for something else and Im wasting your time but I guess I need some advice.

Really need some uplifting words of encouragement cause I feel really hopeless and tired of life. My ex told me that he hopes I never find love or happiness and that I was the biggest mistake hes ever made. I still love him and it just hurts to hear those words. I really do wish sometimes I was dead so he wouldnt have to deal with me or have to hear those words. I feel like such a burden. Please with this virus going around I cant do much to distract myself from harmful thoughts or go see friends to confide in...,Really need some uplifting words of encouragement cause I feel really hopeless and tired of life.

"I joined a discord server awhile ago that has a couple of my friends. This server also has their friends, and one of them is a jerk. I was just in a huge argument with him. He instigated it and insulted me a lot more then I did him. In the discord we tried to make it like a democracy. Then this guy came and ruined it. He has no respect and really just a sucky guy. I can tell his parents are either overwhelmed with a lot of kids or their bad people. He clearly doesnt get the support he needs and hes a bully. I just left the discord and Im trying to get some of my friends to join my new one but only one has joined and he says he might not stay for long. I really need some encouragement right now, so Im asking a bunch of internet strangers. P.s. taking a walk to cool down hopefully it makes me feel better.","I joined a discord server awhile ago that has a couple of my friends.

"Right now Im sitting in my dark and empty house and I dont know if I can do this thing called life. Ive been battling this demon for years now. No one knows whats really going on with me. Ive tried to talk to people about it but they all have the same carbon copied answers - Youre gonna be okay. Itll get better soon. Im sorry youre going through this.  I dont think I will though. I know I need to talk this out with a professional, but I cant afford that or the insurance to cover it. Its cruel how the world keeps on going after your own world lies in ashes at your feet. Tbh, I feel empty inside. I have for quite a while now. Thats not really the truth though. I do feel something. Fear. Im afraid of losing those I care about. Im afraid that Im not good enough. Even now, Im afraid that youre thinking Im being melodramatic when all Im really doing is trying to describe whats going on in my head. I know Im self destructive and I dont care. That makes me afraid of the person behind the mask I put on every day to face the world.I want someone to care. Anyone.","Right now Im sitting in my dark and empty house and I dont know if I can do this thing called life. Ive been battling this demon for years now. No one knows whats really going on with me.

"Hey all. My girlfriend and I just adopted a rescue dog (German Sheppard) and brought her home yesterday. The thing is, she is a REALLY tough case and really put us through our paces last night and this morning. We could really just use a little cheerleading to boost us up and keep us going for a minute. We've both had tough dogs before, but it's been a stressful time in general so it is extra tough at the moment. Thanks! &lt;3","Hey all.

"Hi all, Im 22 and Im stressed out. Admittedly I thrive in tense and high stress situations. I come from a conservative, Christian, middle class family in PA.  Im an only child and I still live at home. I dont have my own car and Im one year out from finishing my degree. I decided to join the Army National Guard to find my last year of college. Times are getting rough at home. Parents are done paying for school, rightfully so, but refuse to co-sign on any loans. Knowing this, I enlisted into the Guard. Well two days before I was supposed to ship for Basic Training I found out I was pregnant. The man isnt my official boyfriend, we have been involved for over a year but we got back together after a big break up, just never officially stated were bf/gf. My parents dont approve, mostly because I painted him in a bad light to them and theyre stuck on me dating someone who fits in more with our family. They refuse to let me use any of their cars to drive to see him, and insist he picks me up. Well, at some point in time, eight weeks ago, I got pregnant. When I didnt get my period, but still felt like I was having cramps, I thought nothing of it.","Hi all, Im 22 and Im stressed out. Admittedly I thrive in tense and high stress situations.

"He goes into a rage and starts calling me out of my name and berating me once again. He's telling me I'm trash, that's why I don't have a ring on my finger, all of my relationships in the future will result in men passing me around because I'm a grimy person. I fall for this trap and lose my shit and get into a verbal altercation with him. What made me really blow a gasket is when he tells me that he gave me another chance and I haven't changed my behavior. I hang up on him. I decided to call him later in the day and noticed my number was blocked. This isn't the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth time he's done this either. I get upset again, so I call his mother and tell her whats going on and state that I feel my son should not be going out of town with him because my partner has a habit of not answering phone calls because he's upset with me and I don't want my son out of town and I have no way of contacting any one to see how he's doing while he's away from me.","He goes into a rage and starts calling me out of my name and berating me once again.

"Hi everyone,I'm feeling sad and could really use some encouragement. I've been on and off slightly sick for weeks, just body aches and fatigue that lasts only a day. Well, a few days ago I had that again, along with a minor fever, but this time the symptoms have lasted several days. It is totally bearable, but I am just feeling really emotional and tired of being sick. Today my fever is a little worse, and on top of that, I'm in grad school and my current class has us reading several readings a day plus long blog posts. I'm tired of having to read all day, write a long blog post, and being sick on top of that. I just want to lay in bed all day and relax, nap, and cry a little. I apologize if this post is too ""complain-y"" and I know there are much more important things in the world than me being tired of being sick. I am so thankful that I can do school from home and not have to go out for work, especially with the pandemic going on. I am also thankful that my symptoms are not as bad as many people right now, but I am also really scared that this might lowkey be covid and the symptoms will ramp up. I could just use some encouragement right now.","Hi everyone,I'm feeling sad and could really use some encouragement.

"So I've had a less than perfect life. I joined the army. I graduated from a community college. I had major problems with my parents. (I've been living on my own struggling to survive for like a decade.)I went as a religious person living in a European country to ""preach the word"" for two years. I learned another language.Anyway I'm 30 years old trying to get a computer science degree. I thought all the math I needed was calculus 2. I made it through, and decided to take linear algebra over the summer. It's killing me. I have a test tomorrow. I've been doing like 14 hour days studying. (I have another class.) I have no shame, may I have some encouragement? Thank you reddit","So I've had a less than perfect life. I joined the army. I graduated from a community college. I had major problems with my parents.

"Hi all. I would love some positive encouragement, words of wisdom, whatever ya got. I work incredibly hard, help everyone I can, make a big difference for a lot of beings and yet my bank account barely says it will pay for Christmas. Im so disheartened by what feels like the overwhelming weight of never being out of a hole of huge debt and having to constantly be checking the bank account to make sure I have enough for whatever is coming. I have a pretty significant health issue that every once in awhile gets me down, and it feels like that, paired with being tired of working so hard all the time to help other people succeed first, is just too much. Im mad, Im heartbroken, Im sick to my stomach that its like Im doing everything I can to be the type of person who gets rewarded, but the rewards just arent big enough for reality. I try to focus on being positive and grateful for the incredible things I have but FUCK, its so hard sometimes to keep going on with it all.","Hi all.

"Ive been feeling kinda down and ugly lately. If you check my profile, you would see that a lot of the recent stuff I posted is similar in idea. I really want to talk to my crush but it would never work out because hes way out of my league. And Im serious. He plays baseball so hes fit, hes super super smart (AP classes! And he never does the precalc hw but he does great every test), hes humble (when I told him I got a hundred on my English midterm, he seemed genuinely happy even thought hes in much higher level classes than me), and hes fairly attractive.Ugh, hes probably the most mischievous little person around his friends and then hes nice- almost shy- with people that arent his friends.  And his face turns bright red, its adorable. He would never like me back. My friends say Im pretty but I think theyre lying. Im not the dumbest (my precalc grade would argue otherwise) and Ill admit Im in honor classes and Ive got a poem published in a book but thats about it. I try to stay fit too so its not like, health wise, were super different. I dont think it could ever work out anyways and I dont think his friends would approve of him dating me and I also think that  he would probably go chase the pretty girls that are also in the AP classes and equally as smart as him. I dont know what to do anymore. Hes all this cool stuff and Im just me and I wish he wasnt so out of my league. Im 16 btw if that changes anything ","Ive been feeling kinda down and ugly lately.

"I just didn't want to keep being diagnosed and fighting for disability and stuff over and over, I was tired of it after 15 years of doing it. All those 15 years I never worked (because if you work or volunteer at all your automatically disqualified for any disability or help at all.) So, I didn't work or volunteer for anything those 15 years and now those years are gone and I can't get them back. Now I'm back living in Toronto Ontario Canada and I'm 32 years old. I still haven't graduated high school, never been to a college or a university, I have no training in anything, and I have no work experience. When applying for jobs those that are hiring don't care at all about my history they just see it as some big sob story or that I'm just lazy and didn't try hard enough. I'm going to try to get on Ontario Works (which is government aid) when my health card comes in the mail (have to have that to apply for Ontario Works, I don't know why but that's one of their rules.)

Of note I'm married with a 6 moth old daughter.Well...I showed up to my first calculus test (I originally passed it with an 89.6 in 2002 but am retaking it to prepare for calculus II) and the teacher told us we couldn't use our calculators and to put them away. We all panic.  I didn't even finish the test.  Well, I just got back my grade and it's a 37/100 and I'm panicking thinking this was all a mistake quitting my career to go back to school just to try and find a career I was actually passionate about.

"I transferred to a new school this semester with a 3.7 GPA, but since transferring I've been struggling a lot. The workload and material aren't any more difficult than before, but I'm guessing the transition to a new school out of state and away from my family for the first time, in addition to being sick 5 times during the semester, has made it difficult. I have an A, Bs and a C in my other classes at the moment, but my current biology class is the only one I have an F in. I've never failed a class before and I'm trying my hardest to redeem myself and ace the last two exams, but my confidence is not there. I'm already a semester behind because of transferring, I don't want to have to retake a class, and I don't know if I can get into vet school if I do fail. I've been having a panic attack all day and I know it's extreme, but I can't stop thinking about giving up and just dropping everything. I ask for words of encouragement to help me stay motivated through this.","I transferred to a new school this semester with a 3.7 GPA, but since transferring I've been struggling a lot.

I am a struggling makeup student for 3 years and I finally got my first paid job for working on set for a short film. I was extremely anxious over it and stayed in a hotel for 4 days just to get some work experience which I never thought I could do this early on in my course. I did it and smashed it and I wasnt tagged in the promo post by the director who is also a student btw when he tagged everyone else. My parents werent too fussed either. I thought this was gonna be this massive achievement but now I feel like maybe I shouldnt feel so proud of myself as I am.,I am a struggling makeup student for 3 years and I finally got my first paid job for working on set for a short film.

"My wife and I recently moved to be closer to her family to help with childcare. I was making $40,000+/yr at a restaurant.  I've worked in restaurants most of my life and have truly come to hate it. So with the move, I decided to try to do something different.  So I got a job in a completely different industry and now only make $15.50/ hr, about $30,000/yr. My wife just got a job making $13/hr.  I'm struggling seeing us making enough money to obtain our goals. We are currently living with her parents. We have two kids and the oldest will be starting preschool in a year or two. We still need to get another car for myself that's big enough for all four of us.  And we really want to start thinking about buying our first house instead of renting. Are we going to be OK? Can someone just call me crazy and say it's going to work out?My wife's reaction was to start yelling that this is why she hates being with me.  Nothing is ever good enough for me and I'm incredibly hard on my self because I want to be and to give my kids everything I didn't have.  And I don't think I'll be able to with only $15/ hr.","My wife and I recently moved to be closer to her family to help with childcare. I was making $40,000+/yr at a restaurant.

"I am going on a journey of self discovery and Im really scared to open up about something personal that I need to ask. Im afraid that I wont be accepted or that people will treat me differently or like Im not normal if I do open up about this which is why Im deciding to ask a bunch of internet strangers in another sub that is more suited to my issue (sorry guys but this just isnt the right place for THAT encouragement) I really just need to be encouraged that it is ok to open up and dive into this self exploration. Im truly terrified of what others are going to say or do because of my upbringing (very religious, still am) and the nature of the subject at hand :/ I even went to far as to make an alternate account with a new email so my friends and family that use reddit cant find me on here and find out about this before Im good and ready to tell them. Please just encourage me to begin this self discovery and take the steps I need to help myself figure out who I am truly. Sorry for the long read, but thank you in advance! (Ps, I think Im more insecure because I tried to do this once before with the wrong group of people and they totally brushed me off in order to bring the spotlight to their own self and their issues instead and Im scared of that happening again)","I am going on a journey of self discovery and Im really scared to open up about something personal that I need to ask.

"Once again, my dad called me ""worthless,"" ""bitch,"" and ""asshole."" He's never used the word ""asshole"" on me before, so that's a new one. But anyway, I'm getting kind of sick and tired of him telling me this stuff. He always does it, and I'm starting to lose count of how many times he's verbally hurt me like this. You don't know how many times he's told me I won't have a future. After all, I'm out of the house in 4 years. He keeps reminding me of that like he doesn't want me anymore. I'm l just a Freshman, and I don't know what to do in life! It probably sounds ridiculous, I know. Literally, the only thing that is keeping me together at this point is the internet. People encourage others and make people laugh, even though you don't know them. Under all the craziness of school drama and life, I can still find some good online.   Anyway, I just need some tips on how to get my dad's words out of my head, or at least a link to a funny meme to cheer me up or something. I just need to stop overthinking all the stuff he yells at me for. I'm not good at explaining stuff, so can you just throw some comments at me? It seems like I'm just asking for attention, and now that I think of it, I probably am.

"Hey there everyone! I am a Russian guy who desperately tries to get a driving license for himself but have failed miserably 3 times already. I am here for the 4th time trying to get into the right mindset to I finally accomplish what I want today but I am awfully nervous. The thing is that when I drive with an instructor from driving school where I went, I feel at ease and I relatively good at it but when it comes to passing the test and I have an officer riding shotgun who observes me driving, assessing me, I am get all messed up. I get so nervous that my mouth becomes dry, palms sweat, feet shake and I just cant get my mind straight. I am so mad because of that. I know that I have enough skill to pass the test but this nervousness gets the best of me. Please, encourage.Edit: thanks for kind words, everyone! I passed! I cant describe how helpful your kind words were. Thanks a lot! I am grateful to have Reddit installed on my phone, Jesus Christ. I can rest now.","Hey there everyone!

"Some background: I work inventory for a website that sells trading cards, and I've been mildly crushing on a coworker for awhile now. She's nice, funny, quiet, shy, cute, and from the little bit we've interacted she seems like an interesting person. We haven't interacted much outside of passing conversation because I'm also a pretty quiet and shy person, so the few times I've had the chance I've never been able to think of a way to interact with her without it seeming very forced or making it awkward for one or both of us. The crush level has gone up recently because she got me a cheesecake platter for my birthday. Not an unusual thing as she's always bringing in cookies for everyone but it made my day all the same. I've got the chance to return the favor, but it's not under quite the best of circumstances; She's got a surgery scheduled for this week, and while it's not major she's said she's still really scared (Can't blame her). Add in her having a bout of the flu and she's been in a pretty bad place the last few weeks.I decided to get her something to cheer her up and settled on making her cannoli (I saw from a FB post of hers that she liked it) and spent the last few days carefully finding out her favorite flavors and any food allergies she may have without directly asking her.","Some background: I work inventory for a website that sells trading cards, and I've been mildly crushing on a coworker for awhile now.

"I'm struggling right now in many things. I have a bachelor of science in graphic design, but it's a popular career and I'm just not competitive enough. When my old job falsely accused me of assault, I got a certificate in technical writing to boost my chances at a new job. When I learned I might need to somehow move into a senior community to help out a friend, I got a certificate for in-home senior care so I could be his caretaker. Due to the pandemic, many certification classes are extremely cheap. So I picked up a photoshop class to boost my chances of a side job with graphic design even though the degree should technically cover it.Now I seem to have an ""addiction"" to getting more education and certificates. Im not spending $1000s of dollars for a class so its not like I'm ""spending money I don't have"". As I said, most of these classesare on sale due to schools trying to help either people who were laid off find new skills or people who are in quarantine find new hobbies, and they are usually between $10 and $25 each depending on the class.I ended up picking up classes to get certified in copywriting, dog training, and digital photography on top of what I mentioned above. I'm starting to regret picking up these new skills- like it feels like I'm trying to compensate or fill a void now.Am I biting off more than I can chew here? Am I doing too much? Is there such a thing as too much learning? Should I stop? I could just use a little direction and confirmation that this choice to learn more will not end up disappointing me in the future.","I'm struggling right now in many things.

The past few months have been absolutely dreadful, from moving in to an apartment to being late on rent every single month. My parents are separated so theyre always fighting over who should help me when money gets tight. Ive ran through about 3 jobs at my new location and cant seem to find the best job to keep me steady. I turn 20 literally on Friday and the fact that Im 20 with no stable income and barely getting by is killing my motivation and the way I want to handle things in life. I just feel like I have nothing going for me anymore. The only thing I can say Im motivated about is starting up my own kicking camp to teach high school football kickers the most important techniques and tips for training and in game situations. Besides that I cant find something to hold on to that would keep my head high and keep my motivation running. I just feel lost and empty and I wish I could ask for help but I know Ive already asked too many times.

Even now, Im afraid that youre thinking Im being melodramatic when all Im really doing is trying to describe whats going on in my head. I know Im self destructive and I dont care. That makes me afraid of the person behind the mask I put on every day to face the world.I want someone to care. Anyone."
"I feel as though all of me is ready to die.Since I left my job, no more quality health insurance. I only have access to basic services. I made an appointment at a behavioral health place nearby, but my first impression was not good. I want to be honest when I go in to seek their help, so I imagine whoever is tasked with speaking to me will find that helping me will be a challenge. I dont want to play nice. This is serious. Ive had a therapist for years, someone who I deeply trust and believe in. But I think not even someone of her caliber can help me now.I dont know what to expect from an online community like this. I dont know what to ask for. What are the magic words to dispel this curse? Should I keep busy or take a break from everything? Thanks in advance if you care to try.","I feel as though all of me is ready to die.Since I left my job, no more quality health insurance. I only have access to basic services.

"I'm an artist with original story ideas, many of them over 10 years old, but I've never been able to sit down and finish them. And that fact tends to extend to so many projects. I'm capable of doing so much art for others at huge speeds (commissions) and in that sense I'm super productive (multiple illustrations a day, even if rhey are small). I can easily sit down in the morning and producing art until before bed, but when it comes to my own stuff, it's almost impossible to just sit down and finish projects, be it an artbook, a plot, a comic, a game... I always end falling back into drawing commissions or illustrations, which I can finish with ease.It seems so many gamedevs or comic artists finished projects by the time they were my age or just a bit younger. Shouldn't I have projects behind me and not just illustrations by now? I'm getting closer to finishing stuff, but while I suffer of a quarter life crisis I fear I will just get old too fast to get it all out. It's a scary thought... I sure hope my capacity to produce become exponential with time or rejuvenation therapies become mainstream or something, because the stress is not going to help me make a better product either","I'm an artist with original story ideas, many of them over 10 years old, but I've never been able to sit down and finish them.

"I guess Ill explain my situation. For about 3 months now Ive been talking to this girl. After our first date she said she didnt feel anything for me and so I tried to move on. After about a week of not talking to her she texted me asking how my day was. Since that day she started talking to me non stop every day. She then started to get kind of flirty and lead me on. When I talked to her about it, she said she was confused because she didnt feel anything originally and now she thinks things are changing. I was excited and so I just kept doing what I was doing and things were going great. Things went bad on Friday the 27th. The subject of our relationship status got brought up again and she said she was conflicted and part of her wants to just remain friends and part of her wants something more. I asked her if we could talk about it in person but we had to end up FaceTiming. It turns out all that flirting and leading on was her intentionally doing that to see if she was interested. What I took as affection turned out to be experimentation and at this point she was trying to avoid telling me the truth. Ive been rejected before but this one was different.","I guess Ill explain my situation. For about 3 months now Ive been talking to this girl.

"Im a freshman in college and recently I moved about an hour away from home to attend school. The past few months have been absolutely dreadful, from moving in to an apartment to being late on rent every single month. My parents are separated so theyre always fighting over who should help me when money gets tight. Ive ran through about 3 jobs at my new location and cant seem to find the best job to keep me steady. I turn 20 literally on Friday and the fact that Im 20 with no stable income and barely getting by is killing my motivation and the way I want to handle things in life. I just feel like I have nothing going for me anymore. The only thing I can say Im motivated about is starting up my own kicking camp to teach high school football kickers the most important techniques and tips for training and in game situations. Besides that I cant find something to hold on to that would keep my head high and keep my motivation running. I just feel lost and empty and I wish I could ask for help but I know Ive already asked too many times.

I have had 2 interviews with a floral shop and a few via email and they always ghost me when they ask to see photos. I have tons of experience from landscaping making planters for all seasons. I also understand variety, textures, colours etc I am just bogged down by no one giving me a chance. I built a bouquet at an interview and she said she was so impressed, and despite telling me she'd call back, she just ghosted me.

"I've been away from school for a few years dealing with personal things and now I'm finally deciding to go back. I have a lot of doubts and insecurities about how much money I'm spending on a degree that might not actually do me any good, especially since I took a few years off from getting it. But this is not a decision I'm making lightly, and it's one I've spent many many nights thinking about. It seems every time I bring up these fears with people they advise me to keep waiting until I'm sure, or to think about getting a different degree. They love me and are trying to support me, but I think they miss the point... and I've only felt worse since I began making these fears known. To clarify I'm going back for a science BA in geology, a passion of mine. Any sort of words of positivity or encouragement would go a long way for me. I try my best to be an optimist, but lately I feel very pessimistic about this very big deal in my life that I was originally looking so forward to.

But, I did just come out as Bisexual and have been really wanting to explore a relationship with a female.

"Yeah, of course I'm nervous. But I hope I can finally do it. And that's the important thing. Right? Is it gonna go well? Only time will tell. But hopefully with a bit of positivity I can work up the courage at the right moment.

Really need some uplifting words of encouragement cause I feel really hopeless and tired of life. My ex told me that he hopes I never find love or happiness and that I was the biggest mistake hes ever made. I still love him and it just hurts to hear those words. I really do wish sometimes I was dead so he wouldnt have to deal with me or have to hear those words. I feel like such a burden. Please with this virus going around I cant do much to distract myself from harmful thoughts or go see friends to confide in...,Really need some uplifting words of encouragement cause I feel really hopeless and tired of life.

It starts to get late so I collect all of his belongings and try to turn his pandora off when I noticed his phone was accessible. I do the unthinkable and start looking through his phone. I only did this because early in the day he was acting very strangely and purposefully start arguments with me out of thin air. I ask him whats going on and he protests that nothing is the matter. We take pictures but I just have this gut feeling about him because he is starting issues with me for no apparent reason. I go through his phone and find him talking to TWO other females and making plans to visit them and talking about my son with them. I get enraged and start verbally attacking him as soon as I see him.

Hello everyone!This is my first post on Reddit. I haven't been feeling too well lately I was throwing up and had a really low blood pressure due to anxiety ups and downs and I injured a part of my back on my birthday today and could hardly walk because of all the pain. Just felt kind of lonely since I have also had a hard time emotionally lately due to a lot of stress and don't really have friends or family like people that knew at all where I am and it's just raining the whole time lol. Still glad I have my bf with me :)Thanks everyone ,Hello everyone!This is my first post on Reddit.

"So. Im a near-first-time cosplayer, and Im not very confident in myself. For reference, Im in middle school (Almost done!), so confidence doesnt necessarily come easily. My sister and her entire friend group cosplay a bunch and sometimes, when I look at their cosplays, I think theyre way better than mine ever could be, even though I know theyre older and more experienced. Im actually in my Tanjiro cosplay right now, and I want to post it to /r/cosplay, but Im really scared someone will diss me because its not good or I dont have contacts or something. This is kind of a stupid problem and pretty light compared to some of the other, heavier stuff on this subreddit.","So. Im a near-first-time cosplayer, and Im not very confident in myself.

"Tried to go back to warehouse work but the pain in my legs, feet, hips and back was excruciating. Only lasted 3 months. Husband was the bread winner and I did literally everything else. All he had to do was bring home a check. I scheduled appointments, paid bills, cleaned the house, planned meals, grocery shopped, etc. I was already doing that while also working. It was nice to only do one side of it. We bought a house. 1 month later my husband lost his job of 7 years. In the 2 years since, he has worked a total of 5 months. We cashed out his 401k. It lasted a year. I tried another call center. Cried so they let me go. We don't have the money for food, but Im trying to eat right and exercise anyways. Husband refuses to work. He won't clean. He won't talk to me about our future. He won't get his driver's license. Still wants sex though, even though it's painful to me and I need to see a gyno. Im happy he still wants me. Im afraid he will stop one day. Im still doing everything.","Tried to go back to warehouse work but the pain in my legs, feet, hips and back was excruciating. Only lasted 3 months.

I want to go into the film industry with the goal of being a screenwriter/director or possibly even an editor. Honestly I'm open to anything within the film industry if I enjoy it. I know it's a super hard field to go into but its the only thing that I have ever been passionate about in my life. I graduate from college in less than two years and have no clue what to do after. I'm thinking about moving to California but it scares me. I know that I have a big chance of failure but I also know that if I don't pursue this career that I will regret it for the rest of my life and will always think about the what if. I guess I'm just looking for somebody to say it'll be alright and don't give up. Thanks!,I want to go into the film industry with the goal of being a screenwriter/director or possibly even an editor.

"Hello Reddit community!This is my first post ever, and I'm looking for some  support, encouragement and logic about the situation to calm my nerves.About 3 months ago, my fianc and I were in the emergency room because he had really severe abdominal pains. They did an ultrasound and told him that his gallbladder is full of gallstones. Tomorrow, he is scheduled for surgery, and I've been anxious as heck. Now, I know that it's not logical to be anxious about it. Gallbladder surgery is fairly common and low risk. I had the same procedure about 5 years ago and I was fine shortly after. As long as the laparoscopic procedure works out, My mind, however, is still racing with worst case scenarios. He's never had anesthesia, so what if he's allergic? What if something goes wrong, and there's a complication? What if he dies during the procedure, and I never see him again, how would I cope without him?Obviously, I don't try to entertain these thoughts, but they sneak in and I can't turn them off. How do I keep from freaking out and being a nervous wreck until I know he's okay? TL;DR: My fianc is having gallbladder surgery tomorrow and even though I know it's low risk, I can't help but feel nervous and anxious.

But I'm hiding from a lot of people that I'm gay. My closest friends know. My family knows. But the people I'm with day in and day out don't know. So in some ways I'm still in closest there, but what's hurting me the most is those who I'm out to. My friends will just keep making ""fag"" jokes. My family will still keep asking why I haven't found a girl. When I'm going to grow out of ""that phase in college where I dated guys"". I'm tired of being different. I wish I could just love a woman, or be normal... Whatever. I just want someone to tell me I'll be okay. Thanks Internet. ","Hey. 22 year old guy, living in a small town in West Texas.

"I am studying to get a bachelors degree and currently have a month of examinations in my school and I am beyond tired. I am also working 24 hours per week at job so I could live on my own, pay the bills, pay for food. Not a dream job, but it pays the bills. Tommorow I have an exam in a subject that I was not attending for almost half a semester because being there in lectures is just as useless as just not being there. (Was doing other homework in the meantime though, so suppose it was more useful to not be there in the end). About this particular subject I am completely clueless and I should gather my strengths today so I could get past 'fail' tommorow. But I just want to be lazy for once so badly !  I want to do something for my personal goals, I want to spend some more time with my boyfriend, I want to meet my mom, I want a whole day just at home. I like my studies because it is finally something I am very much interested in (except tomorrows exam, but it's only a small part of everything). Still it is hard. I wrote myself a letter in the beginning in autumn that was delivered to my during this hard time of exams. I had forgotten about it and I was very moved when I received it. My past self says that she hopes that I am just as inspired as she is at the moment and hopes I am getting enough rest and she is very proud of me. The last part is the one that moved me so much, I think I just don't get enough reassurement that I am doing enough. I should not be depending on other's peoples reassurement though, but my own, is it not right? But I am soo busy and sad","I am studying to get a bachelors degree and currently have a month of examinations in my school and I am beyond tired.

"Hoo boy. Feeling vomit ahead. So, I'm in my last year of college after failing out a few years prior due to a major depressive spiral, and not realizing I needed some major changes in my life. I've made it this far, but yet I am feeling very panicked. I'm struggling with my finance course (I am not a math/numbers guy in the least) and my microeconomics course. I have lowered my expectations from doing well in the class to passing the class. This isn't what I want. I want to succeed and do well, but halfway through I fall down and stumble my way through the rest of the course. I've already put myself a semester behind schedule because of this. I'm so close but I am dealing with a lot of pressure as well. I can't afford (literally) to push anything back another semester as I am maxing out on federal student aid after this year. I have two courses to take over the summer that will finish my degree (assuming this and the next semester go well enough) and I have no idea how I am going to pay for them, as one is a costly short-term study abroad that I am pretty much pigeon-holed into taking. I feel like a failure for not finishing my degree the first time, and for getting myself into this whole mess by wasting money like crazy that last year at my previous institution among other things. I'm mad at myself for letting myself fall down like this. I'm mad at myself for not learning the first time that I need to be more proactive on things. Gah.Sorry for the feeling vomit. If you made it through all that, congrats, and here's a towel to wipe off the feeling vomit. ","Hoo boy. Feeling vomit ahead.

"There wasn't as many curriculum's then as there is now and the curriculum's weren't as advanced as the one's now. So, anyways when my parents pulled me out of school I was in the 5th grade but after testing me on a few things to see where I was, most of what I knew was a kindergarten level maybe grade one. So, it was very hard work but I did catch up, although unfortunately because my Autism (it's not my parents fault, they honestly tried and so did I) I wasn't able to do the work required of me to graduate. There were subjects I just couldn't grasp and understand at the time. So, I wasn't able to graduate high school. My Mom talked with me about my future (we were living in U.S.A in southern California at this time, we moved there when I was 16 years old) and she didn't blame me for not graduating. She knew I tried really hard and it wasn't my fault or hers or anyone else's that I didn't graduate. So, anyways her and I talked and she thought it would be a good idea for me to live on disability rather then get a job, so I applied. After 15 years of going to several doctors being diagnosed over and over again with Autism and 15 years of fighting to get on disability or any help for my Autism at all and being denied for any help and disability over and over again for 15 years I was done, I had enough.","There wasn't as many curriculum's then as there is now and the curriculum's weren't as advanced as the one's now.

"Hello, im not sure if i will continue to share my encouraging thought because people have been having problems because i use my faith to try to help people i was asked to only post everyother day because apperently im offending people, i dont understand why this offends anyone, if you dont want to read it then dont. But if you like these words of encouragement please respond!!! Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his Lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.
John 15:15 KJV
Dogs love is unconditional, always there for you, always glad to see you, ready to forgive you, love going places with you, will protect you from danger, and on and on. We would be fortunate to have a human friend who is faithful as a canine friend. Actually, we do have such a friend and such more than a four legged friend. That friend is Jesus and He understands everything we go through in life. Jesus can sympathize with our weaknesses. Human friends may disappoint us, but Jesus never will. He is a friend that ""sticks closer than a brother "" (Proverbs 18:24). Have a blessed weekend.  :)","Hello, im not sure if i will continue to share my encouraging thought because people have been having problems because i use my faith to try to help people i was asked to only post everyother day because apperently im offending people, i dont understand why this offends anyone, if you dont want to read it then dont.

The past few months have been absolutely dreadful, from moving in to an apartment to being late on rent every single month. My parents are separated so theyre always fighting over who should help me when money gets tight. Ive ran through about 3 jobs at my new location and cant seem to find the best job to keep me steady. I turn 20 literally on Friday and the fact that Im 20 with no stable income and barely getting by is killing my motivation and the way I want to handle things in life. I just feel like I have nothing going for me anymore. The only thing I can say Im motivated about is starting up my own kicking camp to teach high school football kickers the most important techniques and tips for training and in game situations. Besides that I cant find something to hold on to that would keep my head high and keep my motivation running. I just feel lost and empty and I wish I could ask for help but I know Ive already asked too many times.

"Former Dream of Being a Doctor, Now Changed To Nursing. Looking for Encouragement.Just as the title says, I once had the dream of being in medical school, but due to my low gpa, changed my focus to nursing and I was looking for encouragement. Little back story:For my the longest time, I would say since I was like 7 years old, I was driven to become hopefully become a Neurosurgeon, I often would read material, watch surgeries, and do whatever I could to help me better understand not only the role of medicine, but how it affects the lives and the crucial role it played in the lives of millions of people. I attend the University of Alabama at Birmingham. I was offered a scholarship to the university while in middle school. By the time I took the ACT my 8th grade summer, I managed to score an 28. UAB was impressed by this and offered me a scholarship. Fast forward, I graduated high school with a GPA of a 4.42. I had taken multiple AP and honors classes and so our GPA had the possibility of jumping past a 4.0. College, the good and the bad:Theres really no easy way to say this and I dont want to beat around the bush by it and since I made the mistake, and I want to own it but, I remember it like it was yesterday, my sophomore and junior year, as much as I hate and am embarrassed to say it, I had a huge falling out when it came to school and life in general.","Former Dream of Being a Doctor, Now Changed To Nursing.

"Lately I've been feeling really shitty. I'm a senior in high school, and I'm on my way to being valedictorian, which is great, but I feel under a lot of pressure to win a ton of scholarships and get into some fantastic school. I have practically no support, as my friends just assume that I'm some genius, rather than a hard worker, and I would feel strange complaining about good grades. I recently broke up with my girlfriend of a year and a half, and I've been so active that I feel like I haven't had any time to get my mind straight. She was one of the few people I really connected with, and I had been planning my whole future around the idea of us being together, so now I'm chugging along with no clear destination. I'm having an extremely difficult time coming to terms with the idea that she isn't the one.Throughout asking for help introspective and reflective application essays, I've realized that my parents barely know me. In their attempts to help me with my break-up, they default to useless lessons in Christianity, which I ignore because I am not a Christian. However, my parents don't know this. I've refrained from telling them out of fear of being disowned. My reluctance to reveal this has led to me being the worship leader for my school's Christian organization (along with the fact that I'm the only person in my school who can sing and play guitar). My ex-girlfriend is the only person who knows I'm not Christian. I plan to tell my parents when I get to college, and don't have to live under their roof anymore.I'm hoping that college will be a new start for me, where I can actually be honest and connect with other people, but for the next few months, I'm alone and stressed. I could really use some kind words/good advice, r/encouragement.TL;DRStressed by senior year, emotional over break-up, lying about Christianity. Help?","Lately I've been feeling really shitty.

"I've had a hard time recently because my crush wasn't interested in me. For me, it's been on the rare occasion I feel a special connection with a girl so I have little experience with relationships/dating. Ive only be in a relationship once in the past 3 years and it's kind of taken its toll on me. It's nothing wrong with me (I think), I consider myself an all around good person. It just hurts me on the days when I need a hug or someone to talk too.Any advice on how to feel better?(I'm not sure if this is the best place to post, let me know if there is a better place)","I've had a hard time recently because my crush wasn't interested in me.

"I've taken on a 3-year university course that is said to be really tough, but it's something I'm truly interested in. The thing about this university is that there is no project work, no presentation or participation points to help my grade- EVERYTHING is based on the results of a year-end exam. Last year, I failed ALL my modules and had to resit them, which makes me one year behind. This year, I managed to clear two of my toughest modules, but I failed the other two, which means that I now will take 5 years to graduate.My parents and friends are telling me not to beat myself up over it, but I can't help but feel so, so disappointed that I did not pass everything. I had such expectations for myself too.I guess I really feel insecure about graduating a lot later than everyone else I know. I feel really depressed that I can't do well in something that I like.","I've taken on a 3-year university course that is said to be really tough, but it's something I'm truly interested in.

"For so many years, I have spent so much effort brushing off hateful insults, burying it all inside. I've been able to achieve many things and try to expand on my potential by fighting against this hate. And all I have gotten from my parents is the assurance that any success of mine was due to their constant encouragement. That's right all that bullshit talk and abuse they call encouragement and I've often even believed them. But I know it isn't true or I think I do. All the time I'd almost thought their shit hadn't affected me but it has. As I'm starting out my adult years I feel trapped and I feel like I'm slipping in the wrong direction. I'm having trouble socializing and succeeding in school and I really do feel like I'm an useless nothing. And that's where I need your help. I need encouragement. I need you help so that I can prove to myself that encouragement and love can carry me through. I basically just need someone to care because the only people who I have, have only been bringing me down. It feels good to get that off my chest.

"I'm in a job position I have no experience in making a lot more than I deserve. It's a very technical and specialized position that I have absolutely no business being in. My boss liked me so I was promoted to this three months ago despite knowing fuck all what I was doing. Since then, I feel like I've done okay. Like I get the job done day to day but it's more like I know what to do, not why I'm doing it like that. My only resource for questions is a forum for this particular type of work for this franchise. It's the only one of it's kind. That's all I have. Anytime I have a question, that's practically my only resource short of toiling through thousands of pages of policy documentation to find what I need. Today I asked a question on the forum for clarification and was completely humiliated for it. Several people that have been doing this 10-20 years were mocking me over it, cracking jokes about how my company is fucked with me in this position and how clueless I was. Some people came to my defense and encouraged me to keep asking questions but the people mocking me were the ""hot shot"" posters. Big names of very seasoned respected employees. I felt humiliated and alone. I feel like I can't go there anymore to ask questions, and without that, I'm lost. I do not have the capacity to read thousands and thousands of pages of documentation and policy and study them and learn then by heart. I'm lost. I feel like without that, I don't have the ability to succeed. It's well past my bedtime and I can't sleep because of this.","I'm in a job position I have no experience in making a lot more than I deserve.

"Just need a little encouragement. A man threatened suicide when I told him I no longer wanted to date. I helped him get help and when I thought the situation deescalated, I left. He since has sent numerous texts and emails. Finally, he sent a 4-page letter to my house claiming that I caused all of the anxiety, depression, and desire to end it all. I filed a PFA (protection from abuse) against him. He is an abuser and its going to take a lot to be in the same room as him tomorrow - and to listen to him make up his version of reality, and to fight the protection I am seeking.I am hoping against hope that the judge believes me and is willing to grant this order to give me some peace of mind.","Just need a little encouragement.

I was this underaccomplished loser that barely achieved anything noteworthy in my life, always felt like a disappointment to my family, and here I had just stumbled across something that could change the world. I didnt deserve this, I hadnt worked for it at all, it was literally something I thought of while I was laying in bed after hitting the snooze button.That was the exact moment my psychotic break triggered. I became convinced that none of this was real. All an elaborate farce. My personal version of hell. I screamed and smashed my head against the mirror repeatedly.

I tried to help with as much money as I could, but as the weeks progressed I started to feel like an ATM again, she stopped texting, she stopped calling, only when it was time for me to give money would she come back, now we have slowly drifted apart more she didn't come back last week when i got paid. And now I dont feel anything is left. She has been distant for a long time now, not texting or answering calls. She only said she has shit going on but nothing more.

Im not suicidal, but I sometimes wish for an accident to remove me from this ridiculous society.   I need to know things will be ok, but I dont think anyone knows for sure."
"So I knew I had enough....but when I saw I only had $8. My heart sank....because....I'm the type of person who never buys anything for myself because I have always been broke. I have been scammed out of money through my parents. I have had precious items sold from under my nose by family.....I once had a $100 electoric guitar and $50 amp bought for christmas one year....I didn't even have that for a year. I went to school one day came back and it was gone. My older brother walks in and said he had to sell my guitar and amp to help pay for his rent which was a joke cause he was doing drugs at the time. I was taught by my foster parents that everything had a price for it even if it was a gift so I get really anxious when someone gives me a gift cause I think, ""Oh shit what's the price for taking this?"" I just... I felt really bad that even though I was able to get like $14 of drinks and two cool bracelets too. I felt bad cause I was telling my two friends I was planning on buy pizza for them and cake even though it was for a late birthday party for me but I felt like such a idiot cause I wanted to proved something for them too and I .... I blabbed about it.......I know it's dumb for getting upset about something like this.....but I was just wanting to give myself a party and just not have other people worry about costs of food cause i want to prove for others and just have fun and relax.....but I got so upset at myself cause I wasn't able to get the stuff I just cancelled everything.....And now I'm just getting drunk on my own to just forget how fucking stupid I can be at times.....I'm...... I'm sorry I couldn't get what I planned to have.","So I knew I had enough....but when I saw I only had $8.

"Hi all!Im (40F) just looking for people to tell me its going to be ok. I suffer from anxiety disorder which means I overthink trying to figure out or solve my problems.    I get a physical reaction in my body when my anxiety rises up.    My heart races but also feels like it drops into my stomach.  My stomach starts twisting and flipping and getting jittery.  My face becomes flushed and I also feel light headed.Internally Im freaking out but tend to express it through irritation and anger.    And I know it is all fear based and fight or flight nervous system reaction.    I need to move at the end of the month and no matter how much I try to work the math, it looks like Im not going to have enough money to get it done.    Something has to give, meaning I might be able to pay rent and moving expenses but I might not be able to pay the electric bill or buy groceries for my kids.    I dont have any friends or family I can turn to for help. I know these things have a way of working themselves out but it still fucking terrifies me.    Im trying to think of ways I can earn extra money outside of my full time minimum wage job.    Some encouragement is needed and I hope this is the right forum for this. Thanks for any uplifting advice or anything really.    I dont have a lot of people in my life to tell my problems to, so here I am.","Hi all!Im (40F) just looking for people to tell me its going to be ok.

"Ive been on a downward spiralMy fianc and I have moved in together at the start of 2020, which either highlighted or exposed some major dependency issues that she has. On top of that, her mental health has been beyond terrible for herwhich is likely a huge driving force for the dependencyand Ive gotten Caregivers Fatigue 3 or 4 times already. I desperately want to communicate this issue but she can already read it off of me (been together for a long time) which is making her mental health worse at times, and I think if we were to outright have that conversation it would cause her mental health to be even worse. She also gets upset that it seems like I view her as helpless and unable to function without me, and admittedly I do because shes so extremely needyI hate myself physically. Literally from my head to my toes: I cant find a good haircut and the barber that I helped out with that couldnt be consistent, then COVID hit and Im out a barber &amp; reference point for my hair. Im in too low of a funk to consistently care about maintaining my beard which is as frustrating as daily care would be. Ive been gaining fat all of 2020 which not only do I want to lose weight but Im also a nutrition major so thats not a good look.","Ive been on a downward spiralMy fianc and I have moved in together at the start of 2020, which either highlighted or exposed some major dependency issues that she has.

"I've been friends with this guy from across the country for 2 or 3 years now, and I feel like he's been causing me pain for a while now.  I truly thought I enjoyed his company, but now it feels like a redundant step down morally.  He somehow manages to make everyone think he's enjoyable to talk to.  Meanwhile everyone in the Xbox party is being told why their bad or why he's not playing now and it's your fault.  I don't want to end a friendship with someone that's been a part of my life for so long, but him and everyone else on there keeps dragging me back.  It's practicality become an addiction to get on Xbox the second I get home instead of practicing guitar or working out, stuff I want to do.  Even when I thought I could trust him for good advice when I told him that I was depressed he said some bullshit about, ""depression isn't real,"" and ""most people are just looking for pity.""  It's degrading to talk to him, and his posy.  I just don't know if it's worth it to abandon years of voices and personalities for something I'm not even sure if I have the commitment to do.

"Lately I've been feeling really shitty. I'm a senior in high school, and I'm on my way to being valedictorian, which is great, but I feel under a lot of pressure to win a ton of scholarships and get into some fantastic school.

I recently broke up with my girlfriend of a year and a half, and I've been so active that I feel like I haven't had any time to get my mind straight. She was one of the few people I really connected with, and I had been planning my whole future around the idea of us being together, so now I'm chugging along with no clear destination. I'm having an extremely difficult time coming to terms with the idea that she isn't the one.Throughout asking for help introspective and reflective application essays, I've realized that my parents barely know me. In their attempts to help me with my break-up, they default to useless lessons in Christianity, which I ignore because I am not a Christian. However, my parents don't know this. I've refrained from telling them out of fear of being disowned. My reluctance to reveal this has led to me being the worship leader for my school's Christian organization (along with the fact that I'm the only person in my school who can sing and play guitar). My ex-girlfriend is the only person who knows I'm not Christian. I plan to tell my parents when I get to college, and don't have to live under their roof anymore.I'm hoping that college will be a new start for me, where I can actually be honest and connect with other people, but for the next few months, I'm alone and stressed.

"He starts to berate me again and follow me throughout the house and outside. When we were outside his tune changed and tried to make it seem as if I was being crazy for no reason.

"Hello,I am a college student who recently got the flu. I have been told to stay quarantined in my room for 5 days, so i dont contaminate others. I am an extrovert, so this is killing me. Im only 2 days in, I have three more to go but Im already depressed. Not only do i not get to see anyone, but im so sick I cant really get ahead (or caught up) on any work cuz I can only concentrate for a few minutes before I get a headache. (Im already getting a headache typing this.) All i do is sleep and eat snackfood and Im already anxious about whats gonna happen monday when im back in classes and doing ROTC PT (physical training) im usually a pretty positive guy but being in solitary confinement is really brining me down to point where i started crying when my mom called.sorry for the rant.

"We sat there talking about the possibilities for an hour straight.I got overwhelmed and needed to cool off in their bathroom. I was looking at myself in the mirror, and I could feel my brain pulsating and *moving*, like it was rewiring so rapidly that it was causing a physical sensation. Ive never felt anything like it.I suddenly felt enormous guilt. It was as if the universe was angry with me. I had opened Pandoras Box. I was this underaccomplished loser that barely achieved anything noteworthy in my life, always felt like a disappointment to my family, and here I had just stumbled across something that could change the world. I didnt deserve this, I hadnt worked for it at all, it was literally something I thought of while I was laying in bed after hitting the snooze button.That was the exact moment my psychotic break triggered. I became convinced that none of this was real. All an elaborate farce. My personal version of hell. I screamed and smashed my head against the mirror repeatedly.

"Looks like the depression and disappointment hit me post midnight, as Im currently up at 5 am typing this. You know when only *one* small thing goes wrong then suddenly youre all up in a rut about every life decision youve made? Well, Im feeling really shitty about the fact that technically I allowed two things of my own possession to get slightly damaged, all in one night. Due to being lazy in bed, I asked my dad to shake my lava lamp to let the floating hardened liquid to sink towards the bottom. He shook it too hard, causing the whole thing to fall apart and for the lightbulb to lose one of its connector pieces. He said hed go to the hardware store soon to replace the lightbulb, but Im in slight doubt if the lamp will work after that, feeling that its my fault, in technical aspects. If I had simply gotten up to do it myself, then my lamp would have been fine. This is going to also sound ridiculous, but my new phone (no case, no screen protector) somehow slid off the surface I placed it on while doing something this late at night, causing it to hit the hard floor screen first, getting itself some small scratches on its corners in the process. I know the scratches arent that bad, but my obsessive compulsive disorder really tests my tolerance when it comes to the smallest things. And it was a new phone that Ive only had for a couple of weeks, for crying out loud! Why couldnt I have placed it on the floor or on the counter instead? Ive just been self deprecating for the past two hours, so far.In sum from all of this, how do I effectively diminish the thought of I could have done this to prevent this or that so I can learn from these small situations that have been bothering me for the past couple of hours? I guess I somehow have a compass as to how I can solve this, but hearing something from somebody else would really encourage me.","Looks like the depression and disappointment hit me post midnight, as Im currently up at 5 am typing this.

"Ive been on a downward spiralMy fianc and I have moved in together at the start of 2020, which either highlighted or exposed some major dependency issues that she has. On top of that, her mental health has been beyond terrible for herwhich is likely a huge driving force for the dependencyand Ive gotten Caregivers Fatigue 3 or 4 times already. I desperately want to communicate this issue but she can already read it off of me (been together for a long time) which is making her mental health worse at times, and I think if we were to outright have that conversation it would cause her mental health to be even worse. She also gets upset that it seems like I view her as helpless and unable to function without me, and admittedly I do because shes so extremely needyI hate myself physically. Literally from my head to my toes: I cant find a good haircut and the barber that I helped out with that couldnt be consistent, then COVID hit and Im out a barber &amp; reference point for my hair. Im in too low of a funk to consistently care about maintaining my beard which is as frustrating as daily care would be. Ive been gaining fat all of 2020 which not only do I want to lose weight but Im also a nutrition major so thats not a good look.","Ive been on a downward spiralMy fianc and I have moved in together at the start of 2020, which either highlighted or exposed some major dependency issues that she has.

"I have had a rough year and part of the problem is my undiagnosed anxiety.I had a stressful job in January that was pretty much the wild west. But I needed the job because drama at work is sleds stressful than being homeless. In Feb I got super sick and got the flu that turned into a respiratory infection for 3 and half weeks but I got through it. Then I decided to volunteer in some religious work for a few months which ironically stressed me out. Then my job got even worse because we had a ton of layoffs. I was able to find a really good government job but I stressed myself out during the month long process. Then my grandad died and that is a whole can of worms with my crazy family. Stressed me to no end. I ended up not feeling half my body the day after my grandad died. My right side became more and more numb. I went to the emergency room and they gave me a full body CT scan and brain MRI and didn't see any sign of stroke and my vitals looked good. Except that I had some borderline anemic  levels. I was diagnosed with paresthesia. I can feel 100 percent on my left side but my right side has diminished sensation and I have to actively think about moving it. I still have to see my doctor and probably a nuerologist  but it's been ten days and I'm fighting myself to stay calm. I see the doctor on Thursday. My current job is really working with me to get my health in order. I'm thinking that my high blood pressure,averaging four hours of sleep a night for the past year and stress have messed me up.But I have totally cut sugar, focused on getting enough sleep and hoping the doctor can figure this out. Please help me stay calm. I'm going to do what I can to fight this and hope it's temporary with the right medication and time.","I have had a rough year and part of the problem is my undiagnosed anxiety.I had a stressful job in January that was pretty much the wild west.

"I've been unemployed since January, basically fired from a great job I had for a few months. I've applied to jobs online and went to a temp agency but nothing has resulted in work. i don't have health insurance and my savings are being depleted. I have kept my employment hush hush, but I've heard that talking to people in your network can help you land a job. I've created a list of 6 ppl I can reach out to to talk about finding employment and support in my future endeavors (going to grad school). I am full of anxiety that what I say won't make sense, no one will want to help me, my lack of follow through will jeopardize things, etc. Asking for help feels like an excruciating slow death. Sometimes I think it'd be easier just to kill myself. Normally, I'd rather have my teeth pulled than ask for help and be vulnerable, but if I don't do anything I'll have to move back in with my parents (I'm not sure I can survive that and it wouldn't be easy to do b/c of their own issues). I'm thinking about reaching out to everyone on the list in a blaze of motivation. Can I get some encouragement, a little pep talk?","I've been unemployed since January, basically fired from a great job I had for a few months.

I have kept my employment hush hush, but I've heard that talking to people in your network can help you land a job. I've created a list of 6 ppl I can reach out to to talk about finding employment and support in my future endeavors (going to grad school). I am full of anxiety that what I say won't make sense, no one will want to help me, my lack of follow through will jeopardize things, etc. Asking for help feels like an excruciating slow death. Sometimes I think it'd be easier just to kill myself. Normally, I'd rather have my teeth pulled than ask for help and be vulnerable, but if I don't do anything I'll have to move back in with my parents (I'm not sure I can survive that and it wouldn't be easy to do b/c of their own issues). I'm thinking about reaching out to everyone on the list in a blaze of motivation. Can I get some encouragement, a little pep talk?"
"I've taken on a 3-year university course that is said to be really tough, but it's something I'm truly interested in. The thing about this university is that there is no project work, no presentation or participation points to help my grade- EVERYTHING is based on the results of a year-end exam. Last year, I failed ALL my modules and had to resit them, which makes me one year behind. This year, I managed to clear two of my toughest modules, but I failed the other two, which means that I now will take 5 years to graduate.My parents and friends are telling me not to beat myself up over it, but I can't help but feel so, so disappointed that I did not pass everything. I had such expectations for myself too.I guess I really feel insecure about graduating a lot later than everyone else I know. I feel really depressed that I can't do well in something that I like.","I've taken on a 3-year university course that is said to be really tough, but it's something I'm truly interested in.

"I fear for my own future especially career wise. I do want to have a career in something that I love. Something that even on the worst of Monday's and even though it's very hard work I'll just love doing it. Unfortunately, I don't think I'll ever have that. I was born in Toronto Ontario Canada and I'm Autistic and as a child I was misdiagnosed and wasn't given the treatments and therapy I needed. I was put into a special class but it was for kids with ADHD which was what I was misdiagnosed with which I didn't have. Well, I never did well in school because I didn't get the help I needed. To make a long story short I just wasn't making my milestones or coming anywhere close to them so my parents pulled me out of school and homeschooled me. Now, when my parents homeschooled me there wasn't much information about it and not a whole lot of people did it, it just wasn't as common as it is now.","I fear for my own future especially career wise.

"Soooo as title says I have costed out the machines I need for my potential new business venture (side hustle to start) and hopefully one day it will take off as main income.  Ive found what I need and it $15k shipped from China. Other supplier is in Germany but they want 39,000 for same equipment to be shipped. I cant afford German stuff. But I can afford the Chinese version. Now it all looks very comparable online. My thing is do I take the gamble and buy the Chinese machine? I can afford it if it actually turns up and works as promised. But I cant afford to be ripped off and it not turn up or it breaks the first time I use it. Should I take my chances or keep the money in the bank?

"Once again, my dad called me ""worthless,"" ""bitch,"" and ""asshole."" He's never used the word ""asshole"" on me before, so that's a new one.

"These past 4 days have been awful and I don't know what to do anymore.

Oh and not being able to see 2 of my friends wasn't enough I got pulled into the counselors office and told that I will be repeating earth science and that I will be taking a course over the summer. And on top of that my mom kicks me out of the house for 4 hours and I don't have a car so I get to bike in a rainstorm and when I'm finally allowed back in she tells me that I need to fuck off and stop being bad at school.

It's a daytime waitressing position, as I have the tendency to become extremely unproductive during the day and drink to excess when I'm off at 10pm or later. It's happened countless times.Beyond that, I find it nearly impossible to live with a stranger. The last two roommates I have had that I didn't really know have ended badly.

After they encourage me to go to my best friend's wedding in another state and get involved in a local sport (which cost money), I was informed that she was pissed that I had bought sports equipment the other night and that it was becoming time for me to leave. She wasn't mean about it. She just stated that it was time for her to have her space back. I'm worried that after all the changes I have been making, I'm back where I started. I'm in a job that can't sustain me financially. I don't know how I'm going to afford my bills if I move out by February. I know that I can't work any more than 4 days a week with my current class load and my mental health issues. I can't get treatment now because I can't afford to pay for it. And I'd be lying if I didn't say I feel like the rug has been pulled from out beneath me. Maybe they thought I was doing better than I was actually doing. The truth is that talking about my illness stresses out my SIL. My brother offered to listen but every time I try to talk to him he just walks away. So I've only been telling them good things."
"Hi Reddit! I could use some encouragement. My living situation is really weird right now. Three days/nights a week, I live in a small city for my master's program. During that time,  I live in a house with this random older woman (she's nice, but still random) and a roommate. It's comfortable enough, but def not my home and I always feel like a stranger/guest. The other three nights a week, I live with my fiance four hours north in an apartment that we don't love in a town we both hate (it's super rural, we miss our families &amp; friends in another state, etc). So, half the week I'm at school in a weird living situation, and the other half I'm with my fiance in a weird living situation. So, my car is kind of my home. I keep all my stuff in my car all the time (so yes, it's a mess). This arrangement will only last until Christmas break, so I have like 10 more weeks to go like this. This whole thing was my decision and done by my own hand, so I really have no right to complain, but it is still confusing and difficult. To make it all even more weird, one of my professors also hired me to house/dog sit a few nights a week, so I'll also be staying in a third house sometimes coming up. Anyone else ever lived out of their car, kinda? Please share any encouraging thoughts or ideas with me to get through this odd phase of my life!!! ","Hi Reddit! I could use some encouragement.

"Im 16 and from the UK left school 5 months ago, I had no idea of what I wanted to do, what courses I wanted to take at collage, in my 15/16 year old mind I was done with education and wanted something right then and there people would be proud of me for, something that was different and went against my depiction from friends and family as a smart retard with sense of humour that doesnt shut up, so I joined the armed forces, at 16 thats a big thing. So I go, not far from home but not close either, 16 years old moving out when all youve known and seen is your hometown is scary and it took a while but I got used to it, but there I just felt even though their trope was that you could fit in anywhere, I felt more alien than ever before and not myself, I loved off my humour and cracking jokes and being a spastic making people laugh and to be in a place where I felt I was alone but had so many people around me living along side them, it just didnt fit, now people got used to each other people made friends and so did I but I just felt alien to everyone else, now I do have things Im proud of in there, I picked up an injury so missed a lot of lessons so having picked up a rifle for the first time on a Wednesday and having to take it into a test and passing first time on a Friday was something I was surprised i was good at, a zooming through an obstacle course as the others looked on shocked on how good and fast I was getting through it was a feeling Id never felt before, but I knew it wasnt right and at least wasnt the right time, so I left halfway through training.","Im 16 and from the UK left school 5 months ago, I had no idea of what I wanted to do, what courses I wanted to take at collage, in my 15/16 year old mind I was done with education and wanted something right then and there people would be proud of me for, something that was different and went against my depiction from friends and family as a smart retard with sense of humour that doesnt shut up, so I joined the armed forces, at 16 thats a big thing.

Hello everyone!This is my first post on Reddit. I haven't been feeling too well lately I was throwing up and had a really low blood pressure due to anxiety ups and downs and I injured a part of my back on my birthday today and could hardly walk because of all the pain. Just felt kind of lonely since I have also had a hard time emotionally lately due to a lot of stress and don't really have friends or family like people that knew at all where I am and it's just raining the whole time lol. Still glad I have my bf with me :)Thanks everyone ,Hello everyone!This is my first post on Reddit.

"I feel like I was on the cusp of finally getting my dream job (in the arts), but I had to take a long break due to a surgery that had complications.

"Tried to go back to warehouse work but the pain in my legs, feet, hips and back was excruciating. Only lasted 3 months. Husband was the bread winner and I did literally everything else. All he had to do was bring home a check. I scheduled appointments, paid bills, cleaned the house, planned meals, grocery shopped, etc. I was already doing that while also working. It was nice to only do one side of it. We bought a house. 1 month later my husband lost his job of 7 years. In the 2 years since, he has worked a total of 5 months. We cashed out his 401k. It lasted a year. I tried another call center. Cried so they let me go. We don't have the money for food, but Im trying to eat right and exercise anyways. Husband refuses to work. He won't clean. He won't talk to me about our future. He won't get his driver's license. Still wants sex though, even though it's painful to me and I need to see a gyno. Im happy he still wants me. Im afraid he will stop one day. Im still doing everything.","Tried to go back to warehouse work but the pain in my legs, feet, hips and back was excruciating. Only lasted 3 months.

"I'm actually relatively young (26) , and I'm an artist. But for months I've been more and more fearful of the concept of retirement due to ageing, and ageing in general, I guess. The idea that unless rejuvenation sciencie gets as far as expected, my body will start giving in against my will and I will be forced to stop doing what I like.Is it possible to be efficiently active and old? Or do I reach a point in which I peak and then, no matter my discipline, I am condemned to go lower and lower, never doing as good again? Isn't there something I CAN do? Can it be a matter of attitude?  I already am super productive to counter, but it's not helping that much with the fear.Maybe this is the reason why I'm a big futurist and transhumanist, but I'd like to believe I'm not just delusionally grasping a burning nail and have reasons...

"Im 7 months postpartum and having some trouble getting over PPD. Lots of crying lately and being overly sensitive to little things that wouldnt typically bother me. I guess just feeling pretty insecure personally. Also not feeling like myself- I used to do a lot alone like go to the mall, the movies, out to eat. I used to be very tidy and organized. I used to read and crochet. I do almost nothing that I did before I became a mom and now its like everything is about my son and if its not then I feel like a bad mom. Anyways, I just reached out to a girlfriend of mine and asked if she wouldnt mind going out for dinner so I could start trying to get out of the house. Would love some encouragement that this is a good step in the right direction because my heart is actually beating fast from embarrassment.","Im 7 months postpartum and having some trouble getting over PPD.

"We often avoid difficult tasks because we dont know where to start. There may be so much to do, or the job may be so complicated, that were afraid to get going. Before we can deal with this type of task, we must simplify it and organize.Think of the final result. Ask yourself what you must do to achieve this result. Work backwards. Keep asking yourself what you must do. Eventually, you will end up at the beginning.By working backwards, youll break the task down into smaller units. Youll also have a sequence to follow.Check the units. Perhaps you can break them down into even smaller units.

"She was leading me on for a month and a half and I thought I was really getting somewhere. The fact that she tried to feel that way for me and couldnt made everything worse. I know this may sound irrational but I cant help feel that there is something wrong with me and that Im screwed up and thats why this happened to me. Every time I put myself out there I get hurt and this one was a huge blow to the gut. On top of all this, I had a falling out with one of my best friends and he turned some of my other friends against me. I just cant help but feel like everything bad that happens in my life is a direct result of my actions. I had no reason to think that the girl I was talking to would have liked me in the first place. We were barely friends before but after I asked for her number we got really close. She said the reason she doesnt want to make our relationship anything more is because she doesnt want to destroy the relationship we have right now. I dont know how true that actually is. I want to be friends with her but I dont know if she honestly values our friendship or if that is just a load of crap to make me feel better. I feel like Im a failure and I feel like I hurt everyone I'm involved with.

A few years ago I did something horrible to someone close to me. I made amends with this person talked to them and apologized. But I feel as if what I did affects their day to day life so I feel like the things that are going right in my life are undeserved. Anytime something goes wrong in their life I feel as if it is my fault. If they ever don't do something I feel as if it is my fault. If they do something positive I feel as if it is my fault because they are trying to cope. On the bright side they thank me and tell me they don't think they could have done things without me. That they love me and overall I have a good relationship with this person. I just can't get over what I have done. I feel like I don't deserve to talk to someone because it was something that I did. And I don't want it to be about me. But I'm exhausted now.I don't know if this belongs here. Maybe I haven't given enough info. But this is how I have been feeling lately. It's becoming too much. I can't send myself to prison because this person has said it would cause them more pain. I can't off myself because it would hurt this person even more.

It took me awhile to figure this out but i have a fear of things working out too well for me due to superstitions (like it falling apart ) or just doing so well that i have responsibilities that i cant handle.

"My wife and I recently moved to be closer to her family to help with childcare. I was making $40,000+/yr at a restaurant.  I've worked in restaurants most of my life and have truly come to hate it.

I'm struggling seeing us making enough money to obtain our goals. We are currently living with her parents. We have two kids and the oldest will be starting preschool in a year or two. We still need to get another car for myself that's big enough for all four of us.  And we really want to start thinking about buying our first house instead of renting. Are we going to be OK? Can someone just call me crazy and say it's going to work out?My wife's reaction was to start yelling that this is why she hates being with me.

"Hi all. Today I had ny first genetics test. I felt confident when I was studying the material, however the test didn't go so well. I started at the back of the test because those questions are typically longer and harder. I didnt have enough time to answer everything. I left two questions blank which automatically brings my grade down to an 86, and I'm certain I will be docked points for other things. I didnt even have time to look over my answers to make sure they were correct. Feeling kind of low. ","Hi all. Today I had ny first genetics test.

"Hey everyone,I am feeling really overwhelmed, and I wasn't sure where else to turn. My long-term boyfriend left me a few days ago completely unexpectedly, the day before Thanksgiving. We share a house, a dog and two cats. I wouldn't have committed to all of those things if I didn't think he was in it for the long haul. We just renewed our least last month.I have finals for grad school this weekend and next. It's a really hard program that I'm struggling with right now. I need to get an A on one of my finals or I will get kicked out (the program requires above an 85 in all classes and I did really poorly on the midterm).I haven't had time to study. I am so stressed. I can't afford the house on my own, so I have been scrambling for an apartment. I think I found one that I can move to next Monday. I am taking my dog and one of our cats. I feel horrible for them. Do you think they know and are sad?I started a new job (with my same company, but a lot more responsibilities) two weeks ago. I just started a new medication (Zoloft) last week before the breakup happened. There is so much happening and I don't know what emotions are caused by the breakup...or the medicine...or school or the job.I know it will get better...but how can I be ok enough now to focus on school and work? I feel so sad and scared and I'm just really struggling, but I don't want to give up now. I'm sorry that I'm complaining so much. I know I am very fortunate in many ways. I wish I could just focus on that and let go of all of the pain I am feeling.Thank you.","Hey everyone,I am feeling really overwhelmed, and I wasn't sure where else to turn.

"She was leading me on for a month and a half and I thought I was really getting somewhere. The fact that she tried to feel that way for me and couldnt made everything worse. I know this may sound irrational but I cant help feel that there is something wrong with me and that Im screwed up and thats why this happened to me. Every time I put myself out there I get hurt and this one was a huge blow to the gut. On top of all this, I had a falling out with one of my best friends and he turned some of my other friends against me. I just cant help but feel like everything bad that happens in my life is a direct result of my actions. I had no reason to think that the girl I was talking to would have liked me in the first place. We were barely friends before but after I asked for her number we got really close. She said the reason she doesnt want to make our relationship anything more is because she doesnt want to destroy the relationship we have right now. I dont know how true that actually is. I want to be friends with her but I dont know if she honestly values our friendship or if that is just a load of crap to make me feel better.

"I recently got married, then my wife and I decided to foster, then we moved. All within a year and a half. We both use to be so active almost every day. I understand parenting is a priority but with this current child we literally cannot get out of the house. It's just too hard. I use to ride/run up to 20 miles a week and my wife use to run 10ish and do yoga 4 times a week. Now she is lucky to do yoga twice a month and I might get 30 minutes each week to run or ride. I'm kinda depressed, anxious about getting fat and catch myself slipping on my healthy foods. Wife feels the same. Im honestly just thinking about accepting my fate, buying larger clothes and just letting go. I dont want it but that's what seems to be happening.","I recently got married, then my wife and I decided to foster, then we moved. All within a year and a half.

"I'm struggling right now in many things. I have a bachelor of science in graphic design, but it's a popular career and I'm just not competitive enough. When my old job falsely accused me of assault, I got a certificate in technical writing to boost my chances at a new job. When I learned I might need to somehow move into a senior community to help out a friend, I got a certificate for in-home senior care so I could be his caretaker. Due to the pandemic, many certification classes are extremely cheap. So I picked up a photoshop class to boost my chances of a side job with graphic design even though the degree should technically cover it.Now I seem to have an ""addiction"" to getting more education and certificates. Im not spending $1000s of dollars for a class so its not like I'm ""spending money I don't have"". As I said, most of these classesare on sale due to schools trying to help either people who were laid off find new skills or people who are in quarantine find new hobbies, and they are usually between $10 and $25 each depending on the class.I ended up picking up classes to get certified in copywriting, dog training, and digital photography on top of what I mentioned above. I'm starting to regret picking up these new skills- like it feels like I'm trying to compensate or fill a void now.Am I biting off more than I can chew here? Am I doing too much? Is there such a thing as too much learning? Should I stop? I could just use a little direction and confirmation that this choice to learn more will not end up disappointing me in the future.","I'm struggling right now in many things.

"We sat there talking about the possibilities for an hour straight.I got overwhelmed and needed to cool off in their bathroom. I was looking at myself in the mirror, and I could feel my brain pulsating and *moving*, like it was rewiring so rapidly that it was causing a physical sensation.

I was this underaccomplished loser that barely achieved anything noteworthy in my life, always felt like a disappointment to my family, and here I had just stumbled across something that could change the world. I didnt deserve this, I hadnt worked for it at all, it was literally something I thought of while I was laying in bed after hitting the snooze button.That was the exact moment my psychotic break triggered. I became convinced that none of this was real. All an elaborate farce. My personal version of hell. I screamed and smashed my head against the mirror repeatedly.

I call my partner to inform him that I needed his help because my car was disabled. He asked me to drop a pin at my location and I did but it gave the incorrect address, so I gave him the actual address of where I was. Instead of coming to get me, he started to rant about not wanting to be on the road searching for me. I get irritated and curse at him and from then on he argued me to death about he is doing me a favor and that I shouldn't be talking to people in a certain way when I need something. He continued to refuse to come and get me and instructed me to find someone else to pick me up. When I did, he got upset that I even asked him and proceeded to argue with me for the rest of the day. During the arguments he stated that he wish he never met me and had a baby with me and stated that he wished his son was dead.","I had to pull over in a parking lot because it was too dangerous to continue to drive.

"Ive been on a downward spiralMy fianc and I have moved in together at the start of 2020, which either highlighted or exposed some major dependency issues that she has. On top of that, her mental health has been beyond terrible for herwhich is likely a huge driving force for the dependencyand Ive gotten Caregivers Fatigue 3 or 4 times already. I desperately want to communicate this issue but she can already read it off of me (been together for a long time) which is making her mental health worse at times, and I think if we were to outright have that conversation it would cause her mental health to be even worse. She also gets upset that it seems like I view her as helpless and unable to function without me, and admittedly I do because shes so extremely needyI hate myself physically. Literally from my head to my toes: I cant find a good haircut and the barber that I helped out with that couldnt be consistent, then COVID hit and Im out a barber & reference point for my hair. Im in too low of a funk to consistently care about maintaining my beard which is as frustrating as daily care would be. Ive been gaining fat all of 2020 which not only do I want to lose weight but Im also a nutrition major so thats not a good look.","Ive been on a downward spiralMy fianc and I have moved in together at the start of 2020, which either highlighted or exposed some major dependency issues that she has.

"There wasn't as many curriculum's then as there is now and the curriculum's weren't as advanced as the one's now. So, anyways when my parents pulled me out of school I was in the 5th grade but after testing me on a few things to see where I was, most of what I knew was a kindergarten level maybe grade one. So, it was very hard work but I did catch up, although unfortunately because my Autism (it's not my parents fault, they honestly tried and so did I) I wasn't able to do the work required of me to graduate. There were subjects I just couldn't grasp and understand at the time. So, I wasn't able to graduate high school. My Mom talked with me about my future (we were living in U.S.A in southern California at this time, we moved there when I was 16 years old) and she didn't blame me for not graduating. She knew I tried really hard and it wasn't my fault or hers or anyone else's that I didn't graduate. So, anyways her and I talked and she thought it would be a good idea for me to live on disability rather then get a job, so I applied. After 15 years of going to several doctors being diagnosed over and over again with Autism and 15 years of fighting to get on disability or any help for my Autism at all and being denied for any help and disability over and over again for 15 years I was done, I had enough.","There wasn't as many curriculum's then as there is now and the curriculum's weren't as advanced as the one's now.

"Hi.  I finished my original degree 17 years ago and have worked in IT since then but the past year had really made me fall out of \~\~love\~\~ like with that.  I've wanted a masters for a long time with the idea that eventually I'd pursue a new career as a public policy analyst so I've gone back to undergraduate courses in economics and math with the idea if I do well I'll pursue a masters in economics but if not maybe public policy or political science or just go back to work.  Of note I'm married with a 6 moth old daughter.Well...I showed up to my first calculus test (I originally passed it with an 89.6 in 2002 but am retaking it to prepare for calculus II) and the teacher told us we couldn't use our calculators and to put them away. We all panic.  I didn't even finish the test.  Well, I just got back my grade and it's a 37/100 and I'm panicking thinking this was all a mistake quitting my career to go back to school just to try and find a career I was actually passionate about.  I'm enjoying learning but failing that bad has me in panic mode.  I already struggle with depression and I'm hoping to benefit from talking with someone about it.  I don't feel like I can talk to my wife about it. :(","Hi.

"I've lived my entire life with shit being thrown at me.

The rest of the parents would yell things like ""Good try!""""You can do it!"" and ""It's all about having fun."")

I've been called useless and trash and just a few minutes ago my dad told me to keep wasting the little bit of shitty life I have left.

"I've been away from school for a few years dealing with personal things and now I'm finally deciding to go back. I have a lot of doubts and insecurities about how much money I'm spending on a degree that might not actually do me any good, especially since I took a few years off from getting it. But this is not a decision I'm making lightly, and it's one I've spent many many nights thinking about. It seems every time I bring up these fears with people they advise me to keep waiting until I'm sure, or to think about getting a different degree. They love me and are trying to support me, but I think they miss the point... and I've only felt worse since I began making these fears known. To clarify I'm going back for a science BA in geology, a passion of mine. Any sort of words of positivity or encouragement would go a long way for me. I try my best to be an optimist, but lately I feel very pessimistic about this very big deal in my life that I was originally looking so forward to.

It took me awhile to figure this out but i have a fear of things working out too well for me due to superstitions (like it falling apart ) or just doing so well that i have responsibilities that i cant handle. And it holds me back SO much that i dont wanna leave my comfort zone of doing the same boring things every day even though i hate it so much..Some encouragement or advice would be wonderful:) thanks in advance,It took me awhile to figure this out but i have a fear of things working out too well for me due to superstitions (like it falling apart ) or just doing so well that i have responsibilities that i cant handle.

"I'm actually relatively young (26) , and I'm an artist. But for months I've been more and more fearful of the concept of retirement due to ageing, and ageing in general, I guess. The idea that unless rejuvenation sciencie gets as far as expected, my body will start giving in against my will and I will be forced to stop doing what I like.Is it possible to be efficiently active and old? Or do I reach a point in which I peak and then, no matter my discipline, I am condemned to go lower and lower, never doing as good again? Isn't there something I CAN do? Can it be a matter of attitude?  I already am super productive to counter, but it's not helping that much with the fear.Maybe this is the reason why I'm a big futurist and transhumanist, but I'd like to believe I'm not just delusionally grasping a burning nail and have reasons... But I digress.","I'm actually relatively young (26) , and I'm an artist. But for months I've been more and more fearful of the concept of retirement due to ageing, and ageing in general, I guess.

Part of it's probably because I'm paranoid but I feel like they were saying look at the fat girl trying to be like us Jesus Christ she doesn't f****** belong here. And so I ran home. I don't know if I can keep going to the gym and having those negative experiences.

Especially because suffering is a real problem that most people seem content to ignore.I don't care, how difficult it is though.  I like helping people.  Do you?"
"Hi.  I finished my original degree 17 years ago and have worked in IT since then but the past year had really made me fall out of \~\~love\~\~ like with that.  I've wanted a masters for a long time with the idea that eventually I'd pursue a new career as a public policy analyst so I've gone back to undergraduate courses in economics and math with the idea if I do well I'll pursue a masters in economics but if not maybe public policy or political science or just go back to work.  Of note I'm married with a 6 moth old daughter.Well...I showed up to my first calculus test (I originally passed it with an 89.6 in 2002 but am retaking it to prepare for calculus II) and the teacher told us we couldn't use our calculators and to put them away. We all panic.  I didn't even finish the test.  Well, I just got back my grade and it's a 37/100 and I'm panicking thinking this was all a mistake quitting my career to go back to school just to try and find a career I was actually passionate about.  I'm enjoying learning but failing that bad has me in panic mode.  I already struggle with depression and I'm hoping to benefit from talking with someone about it.  I don't feel like I can talk to my wife about it. :(","Hi.

"Im in desperate need of encouragement and advice or just anything positive. Im going through a very tough time in my life. My husbands cancer has spread and hell be having surgery this month. Hes staying with his Mom house in my hometown, so were living apart. We probably need to move back to my hometown after a year living hours away since our support system is there and since thats where my husbands team of doctors is based. My mom just died in March and because Im a contractor for my current job, they didnt pay me for the whole week and a half of work that I was out. So moneys been tight. I had to replace my tires recently. Work hasnt paid me back for my travel expenses. Now Im job hunting again and looking for new places to live. Im pretty broke, I cant visit my husband because the drive is so far and challenging and I only have less than 48 hours to make the trip. Im dealing with the loss of my mom, and how Im so unavailable because of my job, but I cant take a break from it because I wont get paid for it. Plus Im just feeling so shitty and unhappy with my body and Im just struggling so much. I know Ill be ok, but like...its just been bad day after bad day. Im a very positive person and have been handling this well, but Im having a spiral moment. Advice, encouragement and positivity are welcome. Thanks Reddit.","Im in desperate need of encouragement and advice or just anything positive. Im going through a very tough time in my life.

"Looks like the depression and disappointment hit me post midnight, as Im currently up at 5 am typing this. You know when only *one* small thing goes wrong then suddenly youre all up in a rut about every life decision youve made? Well, Im feeling really shitty about the fact that technically I allowed two things of my own possession to get slightly damaged, all in one night. Due to being lazy in bed, I asked my dad to shake my lava lamp to let the floating hardened liquid to sink towards the bottom. He shook it too hard, causing the whole thing to fall apart and for the lightbulb to lose one of its connector pieces. He said hed go to the hardware store soon to replace the lightbulb, but Im in slight doubt if the lamp will work after that, feeling that its my fault, in technical aspects. This is going to also sound ridiculous, but my new phone (no case, no screen protector) somehow slid off the surface I placed it on while doing something this late at night, causing it to hit the hard floor screen first, getting itself some small scratches on its corners in the process. I know the scratches arent that bad, but my obsessive compulsive disorder really tests my tolerance when it comes to the smallest things. And it was a new phone that Ive only had for a couple of weeks, for crying out loud! Ive just been self deprecating for the past two hours, so far.In sum from all of this, how do I effectively diminish the thought of I could have done this to prevent this or that so I can learn from these small situations that have been bothering me for the past couple of hours? I guess I somehow have a compass as to how I can solve this, but hearing something from somebody else would really encourage me.","Looks like the depression and disappointment hit me post midnight, as Im currently up at 5 am typing this.

"I am going on a journey of self discovery and Im really scared to open up about something personal that I need to ask. Im afraid that I wont be accepted or that people will treat me differently or like Im not normal if I do open up about this which is why Im deciding to ask a bunch of internet strangers in another sub that is more suited to my issue (sorry guys but this just isnt the right place for THAT encouragement) I really just need to be encouraged that it is ok to open up and dive into this self exploration. Im truly terrified of what others are going to say or do because of my upbringing (very religious, still am) and the nature of the subject at hand :/ I even went to far as to make an alternate account with a new email so my friends and family that use reddit cant find me on here and find out about this before Im good and ready to tell them. Please just encourage me to begin this self discovery and take the steps I need to help myself figure out who I am truly. Sorry for the long read, but thank you in advance!

My boyfriend has been checked out and does not seem to want me anymore. He offers to do nice things but no more saying I love you and seems really checked out. It's super difficult trying to talk to him. He was the first person I've loved and now it looks like things won't work out. My boss (I am a nurse) has treated us horribly during this pandemic. Does not care if we are safe and gets after us if we wear masks around unscreened patients. Administration backs them up. All them are working safely from home. My old boss said she is posting a better position for me soon. I hope she does. If not i may need to do travel nursing. I have gained so much weight from school and from working nights. I am so exhausted (I am in grad school FT now and am working) and don't run and work out like i should. My new job will be better and I'll be able to workout more. I am not as attractive and thin as I used to be and I can tell by the way guys are around me then vs now. It's depressing. I've always struggled with weight. Things are tough and i know they will get better. It's life. I could use some encouragement though.,My boyfriend has been checked out and does not seem to want me anymore.

"I've got my recipes and all my ingredients, but my brain (Which is very good at self-sabotage) has come up with an outcome I'm having trouble dealing with. Putting aside the anxiety I'm feeling about just giving them to her, I'm utterly *terrified* she's going to think this is some kind of assholish passive-aggressive one-upmanship because I'm making the cannoli rather than buying it like she did with the cheesecake. I could just buy the cannoli and cut all this out, but tracking down the recipes and making them has and will help with the anxiety about giving them to her. I also feel the situation calls for the extra effort. I'll most likely say this when I give them to her, but that doesn't make the thought go away or the whole thing any less daunting.So have at me r/encouragement.

"Ive been on a downward spiralMy fianc and I have moved in together at the start of 2020, which either highlighted or exposed some major dependency issues that she has. On top of that, her mental health has been beyond terrible for herwhich is likely a huge driving force for the dependencyand Ive gotten Caregivers Fatigue 3 or 4 times already. I desperately want to communicate this issue but she can already read it off of me (been together for a long time) which is making her mental health worse at times, and I think if we were to outright have that conversation it would cause her mental health to be even worse. She also gets upset that it seems like I view her as helpless and unable to function without me, and admittedly I do because shes so extremely needyI hate myself physically. Literally from my head to my toes: I cant find a good haircut and the barber that I helped out with that couldnt be consistent, then COVID hit and Im out a barber & reference point for my hair. Im in too low of a funk to consistently care about maintaining my beard which is as frustrating as daily care would be. Ive been gaining fat all of 2020 which not only do I want to lose weight but Im also a nutrition major so thats not a good look.","Ive been on a downward spiralMy fianc and I have moved in together at the start of 2020, which either highlighted or exposed some major dependency issues that she has.

"Im a freshman in college and recently I moved about an hour away from home to attend school. The past few months have been absolutely dreadful, from moving in to an apartment to being late on rent every single month. My parents are separated so theyre always fighting over who should help me when money gets tight. Ive ran through about 3 jobs at my new location and cant seem to find the best job to keep me steady. I turn 20 literally on Friday and the fact that Im 20 with no stable income and barely getting by is killing my motivation and the way I want to handle things in life. I just feel like I have nothing going for me anymore. The only thing I can say Im motivated about is starting up my own kicking camp to teach high school football kickers the most important techniques and tips for training and in game situations. Besides that I cant find something to hold on to that would keep my head high and keep my motivation running. I just feel lost and empty and I wish I could ask for help but I know Ive already asked too many times. What are some tips you would have to keep a persons motivation running?","Im a freshman in college and recently I moved about an hour away from home to attend school.

Ghosted by my college friends when I had a family medical emergency and had to withdraw from school, and my best friend blocked me on everything in December.

"Hi reddit, I'm in serious need of some encouragement words or some advice. Anything will do really. I'm not very good at this but let's give it a try.I'm 24, recently had to quit my job in order to finish my thesis and being able to get my fucking college degree. My Job was very stressful but it was my only source of income, I think I made the right decision by quitting but I'm in a tough spot right now.As you can imagine, working on a thesis is no easy feat and as of this moment I feel incredibly anxious, depressed and overwhelmed. I'm short of time and even shorter on motivation and willingness to live. I have no other income than my savings and I'm living with my parents. I also have to spend ALL the fucking day alone, working on my thesis and taking care of myself.I just don't know what to do anymore and it is only making me more anxious and overwhelmed. If maybe some of you could give me some advice or encouraging words, that would be great!Thank you so much for reading.","Hi reddit, I'm in serious need of some encouragement words or some advice.

Though the hours for the strategy that I am going to employ would involve trading from market open to market close (9:30EST to 4:00EST), but that gives me time for other stuff.:)I also love making videogames just lately everything has been so crammed and stressful and draining, both work and elements of my personal life and getting away from my ex-wife, but I find it's important to remind myself that I'm doing great, have come so far, and have a great future ahead of me; so I just need to keep going and persevere.

"I went to the doc 2 weeks ago due to getting sick whenever I eat. After protonics (for heartburn) and an abdominal ultrasound, we've had no results. Plus the symptoms are getting much worse. Tomorrow I'm going to ask to be tested for diabetes, and ask the dr what else she may recommend testing for. Part of me just wants to find out what it is, so hopefully we can start treating it, and the other part of me is scared to know what is wrong with me. Thanks for reading, and I'd appreciate any positive encouragement you can send my way. <3","I went to the doc 2 weeks ago due to getting sick whenever I eat.

I am a struggling makeup student for 3 years and I finally got my first paid job for working on set for a short film. I was extremely anxious over it and stayed in a hotel for 4 days just to get some work experience which I never thought I could do this early on in my course. I did it and smashed it and I wasnt tagged in the promo post by the director who is also a student btw when he tagged everyone else. My parents werent too fussed either. I thought this was gonna be this massive achievement but now I feel like maybe I shouldnt feel so proud of myself as I am.,I am a struggling makeup student for 3 years and I finally got my first paid job for working on set for a short film.

I've been lazy for too long and I want to make a change in how I work and how I spend my time. My biggest concern is that I won't follow through with the promises I've made to myself surrounding this. Some good vibes would be much appreciated.,I've been lazy for too long and I want to make a change in how I work and how I spend my time.

I just quit a job I loved and I've started at my new place.  They're really different but my old boss was abusive and careless to his employees and I couldn't take it anymore.  I went back to a place I had worked before and I also love it for different reasons.  I'm 28 and I haven't found a solid career.  My new job has offered to pay for classes to get my LTP as I work at a tax firm.  It's really tempting because I would get to stay here with people I love and the pay would be great but my old job was working with kids which i love more.  I want to continue working with kids but I would need to go back to school to have jobs that pay enough.I have anxiety and all of this change and stress has been getting to me.  I haven't cleaned my apartment in weeks.  My husband and I currently live in a low income apartment building which doesn't allow for full student households.  He is in school and if I take classes we would have to find another place to live.  All of this is stressing me out so much and my husband is stressed out and checked out.  I need anyone to talk to but I'm afraid to talk to my friends about this.  When I talk to my husband he doesn't say much.  I just need even a shred of support from anyone because the person I need it from the most is not in an emotional or mental place to give that.,I just quit a job I loved and I've started at my new place.

"I'm so lost. I moved back home (3 states away) to move in with my brother (and his wife and toddler) when my previous job stopped paying the bills. I was told to take my time, do what's right for me, and not to leave until I actually had money in savings again. I am taking a computer course that ends in an apprenticeship in June/July. I have a waitressing job 4 days a week. The money has fallen to $60/shift in tips plus a paltry $4/hr. It's a daytime waitressing position, as I have the tendency to become extremely unproductive during the day and drink to excess when I'm off at 10pm or later. It's happened countless times.Beyond that, I find it nearly impossible to live with a stranger. The last two roommates I have had that I didn't really know have ended badly. This is why I moved in with my brother and his family. I babysit with little to no advance notice a few times a week (for free of course). I try to stay in my room and not make a mess. I try to get up with my niece and let my brother and sister sleep in when I am able. I haven't even been there 6 months.","I'm so lost.

"She wouldn't let me move on to the elite choir, though I auditioned every year and had a high score. My friend let me see her scores, and they were so low and she got in. I tried to do the local vocal competitions twice, and both times she would flake on my time slot for practice and then eventually advised me to withdraw from the competition. I moved on to college. I got into a really great college known for their theater program. I wanted to be a musical theater major and eventually sing on a stage in front of people. But that was a very hard time in my life and I ended up getting kicked out of college for not being able to play. I took work in factories and got married and kind of gave up on that dream. But, I still sing all the time. I hide in the bathroom and sing karaoke on my phone. I learn a new song once a month or so just to test my voice. I try to do twitch sings on my stream sometimes, but I know it's not my best and I'm a small fish so my audience is about 3 people.:P And I'm ok with that. I just want for once in my life to blow an audience away. XD When we have finances, I want to get vocal lessons. I'm working on my weight, I'm morbidly obese so doing community theater right now seems unlikely. What would you guys suggest to get the response I'm looking for when I sing?","She wouldn't let me move on to the elite choir, though I auditioned every year and had a high score.

"Hi.  I finished my original degree 17 years ago and have worked in IT since then but the past year had really made me fall out of \~\~love\~\~ like with that.  I've wanted a masters for a long time with the idea that eventually I'd pursue a new career as a public policy analyst so I've gone back to undergraduate courses in economics and math with the idea if I do well I'll pursue a masters in economics but if not maybe public policy or political science or just go back to work.  Of note I'm married with a 6 moth old daughter.Well...I showed up to my first calculus test (I originally passed it with an 89.6 in 2002 but am retaking it to prepare for calculus II) and the teacher told us we couldn't use our calculators and to put them away. We all panic.  I didn't even finish the test.  Well, I just got back my grade and it's a 37/100 and I'm panicking thinking this was all a mistake quitting my career to go back to school just to try and find a career I was actually passionate about.  I'm enjoying learning but failing that bad has me in panic mode.  I already struggle with depression and I'm hoping to benefit from talking with someone about it.  I don't feel like I can talk to my wife about it. :(","Hi.

"I'm feeling really low. A few months ago on I was promoted to my first management position. I was so excited to be In leadership and I really thought I could make a difference in someone's career. About 2 months ago I got my team, all new hires, and almost all straight out of  college with little or no job experience. They are so rough. After rigorous training almost all of them are rough, to be expected of course.What I wasnt expecting is to have 4 HR issues right of the bat and them escalating me to leadership above me. I have 3 that are are written warnings for attendance, 1 more and will be termed. 1 went to my leadership and asked if I was right. Unfortently I so know this may happen as people might be unhappy, especially if they are having performance issues. All day my leaders tell me that i have such a bad team and they feel so bad for me, that I'm doing great handling it and it's really breaking me in. I work in a corporate environment so it's very tricky to fire someone. This can be hard bc I'm in need to make an example of so.eone but instead people have figured out how to work the system. I go home and I feel so low. I guess its bc I really wanted to be great to my team but I feel like the group I have is horrible. They always have an issue, whether personal, or just unhappy with the job. They come in with a negative attitude and it sucks the life out of me to be positive for them and the rest of my team. The hard part is the need to treat them as though I dont hate them and still provide great management and fairness. I'm just kind of complaining but I'm in some real need of any encouragement right now. This job is not what I wanted it to be and I'm becoming really unhappy due to it.","I'm feeling really low.

"Hi Reddit! I could use some encouragement. My living situation is really weird right now. Three days/nights a week, I live in a small city for my master's program. During that time,  I live in a house with this random older woman (she's nice, but still random) and a roommate. It's comfortable enough, but def not my home and I always feel like a stranger/guest. The other three nights a week, I live with my fiance four hours north in an apartment that we don't love in a town we both hate (it's super rural, we miss our families & friends in another state, etc). So, half the week I'm at school in a weird living situation, and the other half I'm with my fiance in a weird living situation. So, my car is kind of my home. I keep all my stuff in my car all the time (so yes, it's a mess). This arrangement will only last until Christmas break, so I have like 10 more weeks to go like this. This whole thing was my decision and done by my own hand, so I really have no right to complain, but it is still confusing and difficult. To make it all even more weird, one of my professors also hired me to house/dog sit a few nights a week, so I'll also be staying in a third house sometimes coming up. Anyone else ever lived out of their car, kinda? Please share any encouraging thoughts or ideas with me to get through this odd phase of my life!!! ","Hi Reddit! I could use some encouragement.

"There is always a way out of whatever you found yourself in.At the root of worry, we find fear. In an effort to overcome that fear, we try to be brave, thinking that if we are brave, we can defeat it. Bravery doesnt replace or take away the fear in our lives; it just masks and gives us enough strength to act. If we want to stop living with fear, we have to replace it with something else: safety. The opposite of being scared is being secure. We need to stop trying to be brave and start being secure in our Creator. Being secure means we have the assurance and knowledge of being safe in Jesus arms. This assurance allows us to overcome fear. We gain this assurance as we grow in our relationship with Christ. As God becomes bigger in our lives, worry becomes smaller. The elevation of God in our lives helps us line up our values and put all other fears in their place. Jesus is the only security that will keep us from fearing and worrying about the unseen. When we are secure in Christ, we dont have to fear. When we dont fear, we dont have to worry. That worry and fear are now replaced with trust. Where fear separates, trust brings together. Where fear blurs, trust clarifies. Where fear disconnects us, trust re-engages us. No, everything wont make sense, but it wont have to. We wont have to try to make sense out of chaos, but, instead, we can trust that God is in it with us. He will strengthen us and help us. He will hold us in His hand. He is that good. You can be secure in that. You can trust that.No need for the worry anymore. https://token.mesmr.tv/","There is always a way out of whatever you found yourself in.At the root of worry, we find fear.

"I'm 31. I was diagnosed this Tuesday with prediabetes and high cholesterol. They put me on statins. I wasn't surprised. I'm 360lbs and 5'5.I have PCOS and my hormones have always been awful. I don't have periods, never did even when I was smaller. I can probably grow a mustache and beard. The upkeep is frustrating. I have always felt worthless. I was getting gal bladder attacks regularly for 3 years but I thought I was faking it for sympathy. I spent several months trying to get the pain diagnosed. My job fired me for absences, even though I scheduled them and got written permission. Temp manufacturing work. 1 year and a half. Didn't matter. 1 week later I was hospitalized. Almost died. Several surgeries to remove my gallbladder and several stones. When I got home I should've done physical therapy. I was always active. I put on weight. 100 lbs. I tried to do call centers. Found out that years of emotional abuse had made it so I just sob when customers yell at me.","I'm 31. I was diagnosed this Tuesday with prediabetes and high cholesterol. They put me on statins.

"I joined a discord server awhile ago that has a couple of my friends. This server also has their friends, and one of them is a jerk. I was just in a huge argument with him. He instigated it and insulted me a lot more then I did him. In the discord we tried to make it like a democracy. Then this guy came and ruined it. He has no respect and really just a sucky guy. I can tell his parents are either overwhelmed with a lot of kids or their bad people. He clearly doesnt get the support he needs and hes a bully. I just left the discord and Im trying to get some of my friends to join my new one but only one has joined and he says he might not stay for long. I really need some encouragement right now, so Im asking a bunch of internet strangers. P.s. taking a walk to cool down hopefully it makes me feel better.","I joined a discord server awhile ago that has a couple of my friends.

"Hello, it's been a long-time secret hobby of mine to record stuff for fun, but i never had the guts to share my small projects with anyone. Not a single soul. Early this year, I created a YT channel where I can start first by making covers before posting my own-----except that I am still too nervous to share it with others. The thought itself is nerve-wracking for me. Just now, I did try with a friend but it is still making me anxious.I know I need to let others hear my outputs because I need feedback to improve. How do you think I should go about this? I hope it's okay to ask on here. :(Thank you in advance!","Hello, it's been a long-time secret hobby of mine to record stuff for fun, but i never had the guts to share my small projects with anyone.

"Im 7 months postpartum and having some trouble getting over PPD. Lots of crying lately and being overly sensitive to little things that wouldnt typically bother me. I guess just feeling pretty insecure personally. Also not feeling like myself- I used to do a lot alone like go to the mall, the movies, out to eat. I used to be very tidy and organized. I used to read and crochet. I do almost nothing that I did before I became a mom and now its like everything is about my son and if its not then I feel like a bad mom. Anyways, I just reached out to a girlfriend of mine and asked if she wouldnt mind going out for dinner so I could start trying to get out of the house. Would love some encouragement that this is a good step in the right direction because my heart is actually beating fast from embarrassment.","Im 7 months postpartum and having some trouble getting over PPD.

"Hi.  I finished my original degree 17 years ago and have worked in IT since then but the past year had really made me fall out of \~\~love\~\~ like with that.  I've wanted a masters for a long time with the idea that eventually I'd pursue a new career as a public policy analyst so I've gone back to undergraduate courses in economics and math with the idea if I do well I'll pursue a masters in economics but if not maybe public policy or political science or just go back to work.  Of note I'm married with a 6 moth old daughter.Well...I showed up to my first calculus test (I originally passed it with an 89.6 in 2002 but am retaking it to prepare for calculus II) and the teacher told us we couldn't use our calculators and to put them away. We all panic.  I didn't even finish the test.  Well, I just got back my grade and it's a 37/100 and I'm panicking thinking this was all a mistake quitting my career to go back to school just to try and find a career I was actually passionate about.  I'm enjoying learning but failing that bad has me in panic mode.  I already struggle with depression and I'm hoping to benefit from talking with someone about it.

"Using reddit is really nice, it helps me realize that Im not alone in the world. That others have problems just like me, often times worse. This year has been such a rollercoaster ride of hurt feelings, destroyed dreams, and missed opportunities. I found out this year that Im bi. And now Im in a relationship with another guy. My family (heavily Baptist) havent found out and I dont plan on telling them for as long as possible. Same story for my bf only worse. I worry for him, what if they find out? What if it ends? The US is now a flawed democracy and the only thing we have to look forward to is a ffffffucking civil war. My minds full of doubt all the time telling me that I wont be good enough. After all, whats the use in getting an education if people wont listen to the educated? I guess this is just me venting. I know others have issues bigger than me/mine. And I know that doesnt mean my problems dont mean something. Pain is relative to the person experiencing it. Honestly Im ready for the year to end. For new opportunities to come. And the chance for a better life in the future. I have a journal that I put my rants in but I just felt like putting this on reddit for whatever reason.

"I've taken on a 3-year university course that is said to be really tough, but it's something I'm truly interested in. The thing about this university is that there is no project work, no presentation or participation points to help my grade- EVERYTHING is based on the results of a year-end exam. Last year, I failed ALL my modules and had to resit them, which makes me one year behind. This year, I managed to clear two of my toughest modules, but I failed the other two, which means that I now will take 5 years to graduate.My parents and friends are telling me not to beat myself up over it, but I can't help but feel so, so disappointed that I did not pass everything. I had such expectations for myself too.I guess I really feel insecure about graduating a lot later than everyone else I know. I feel really depressed that I can't do well in something that I like.","I've taken on a 3-year university course that is said to be really tough, but it's something I'm truly interested in.

"So, I really want to start up taking acting classes as I've always wanted to act, like really badly. There are plenty of teenage classes near where I live that I would love to try out but I don't have anybody to go with.

"Hi Reddit! I could use some encouragement. My living situation is really weird right now. Three days/nights a week, I live in a small city for my master's program. During that time,  I live in a house with this random older woman (she's nice, but still random) and a roommate. It's comfortable enough, but def not my home and I always feel like a stranger/guest. The other three nights a week, I live with my fiance four hours north in an apartment that we don't love in a town we both hate (it's super rural, we miss our families & friends in another state, etc). So, half the week I'm at school in a weird living situation, and the other half I'm with my fiance in a weird living situation. So, my car is kind of my home. I keep all my stuff in my car all the time (so yes, it's a mess). This arrangement will only last until Christmas break, so I have like 10 more weeks to go like this. This whole thing was my decision and done by my own hand, so I really have no right to complain, but it is still confusing and difficult. To make it all even more weird, one of my professors also hired me to house/dog sit a few nights a week, so I'll also be staying in a third house sometimes coming up. Anyone else ever lived out of their car, kinda? Please share any encouraging thoughts or ideas with me to get through this odd phase of my life!!! ","Hi Reddit! I could use some encouragement.

"Just need a little encouragement. A man threatened suicide when I told him I no longer wanted to date. I helped him get help and when I thought the situation deescalated, I left. He since has sent numerous texts and emails. Finally (much, much later when I thought this was over) he sent a 4-page letter to my house claiming that I caused all of the anxiety, depression, and desire to end it all. I filed a PFA (protection from abuse) against him. He is an abuser and its going to take a lot to be in the same room as him tomorrow - and to listen to him make up his version of reality, and to fight the protection I am seeking.I am hoping against hope that the judge believes me and is willing to grant this order to give me some peace of mind.UPDATE: abuser tried to outright lie and say I kept coming to his building so HE now wanted an order against ME. My incredible lawyer was not having any of that - and I was granted the order. Thank you everyone for your encouragement. I am so relieved","Just need a little encouragement.

I do not understand why I suddenly care so much about what people are gonna think to see a 26 year old doing beginner tricks.

I believe once you get into aviation you have to make up your mindset about facing such unprecedented times, as aviation is a cyclic industry a lot of factors come into play and the whole sector depends on these factors to work effectively. And Covid has uprooted these factors and brought it to a pause.During such times, one can lose their peace and its ripple effect can be seen in different ways.

"I came back to the apartment a short time later and told him, ""I am not keeping your son away from you, but I think it's best that I go home with my because we are not getting a long at the moment."" I created space between the both of us, so he would not feel as if I was in his space or threatening him.

"So, I really want to start up taking acting classes as I've always wanted to act, like really badly. There are plenty of teenage classes near where I live that I would love to try out but I don't have anybody to go with. Acting classes feel like a thing where people would definitely bring a friend along to help them feel less awkward and so i'm sure that everyone in the classes will have at least one person that they know.The problem I have is that none of my friends are remotely interested in acting and wouldn't join the classes with me. I'm trying to get the courage to go alone but right now i'm way too scared to sign up. Any advice on how to not be such a wimp or how to find a friend that likes acting? If it helps i'm 14F Originally posted on r/advice but not getting responses Any advice is appreciated, have a great day!","So, I really want to start up taking acting classes as I've always wanted to act, like really badly.

"I have a part-time retail job which admittedly I love, mostly because of an awesome manager. But it's not enough to live on, so I'm planning to get some electrician training. There's always a market for that, they're unionized, and I love working with my hands. So far, so good. I've located a technical college that:\- is less than half an hour from my house (\*super convenient\*)\- has a six-month certificate program (\*not so short that it feels incomplete, not so long that I get frustrated\*)\- offers job placement assistance after graduation (\*SCORE!\*)\- classes start at 7:45 AM (\*record scratch sound effect...\*)Oh dear. There's a reason I work the evening shift. I know this is a petty thing to get hung up on in the face of such an otherwise-perfect opportunity, but it's been a VERY long time since I've been required to get up early on a regular basis. And now I'm on medication with a side effect of insomnia. My current situation is unsustainable, and these early classes will allow me to stick with my usual evening shift; but I have a long history of being easily discouraged and can already feel myself backpedaling. I need someone to talk me out of talking myself out of this.","I have a part-time retail job which admittedly I love, mostly because of an awesome manager.

For 4 years I have been dating a high functioning autistic woman. (30) She lived with her parents for the entire duration. Recently her father quit his job because he couldnt take a vacation the days he wanted to.Within 3 days of hearing this story I was informed they would be moving across the state and that she would be going with them. Note at this time we had plans for marriage and had a great relationship.Today she ended our relationship. Her reasons where not her own they were the exact parrotings of her parents far right wing conservatives note that I am not white or conservative. We never let this affect anything or even talk about it. 3 months ago I had open heart surgery at 29. I now noticed since then things have gone downhill.Long story short she made me feel used worthless and broken. That I dont have my life together and cannot be a Provider. But I know these are not her words. Unfortunately nothing I say will bring her back. I just need some assurance Im not those things she said.

"So, Ive been on this sub for a bit. There are probably people who have seen some of the encouragements I gave. Maybe you were even inspired by my encouragements.Well, today Im gonna need some of that.You see, I failed my last test. I thought I did very well on it but I actually got one of the lowest grades in the class.I talked to the professor about it and my professor asked if I was paying attention in class because he thought I might be multitasking. He told me some of the answers to the questions from the test were literally from the lecture. And he was right I was multitasking during lectures. Stupid of me right?I just feel like I cant recover from this. I feel like I cant pass this class. Im not even sure I can even finish my major.To sum it up, my confidence has been completely destroyed. I really struggle with believing myself.I was just wondering if any of you could help me.  Im not asking for much. A kind phrase will help. Maybe a bit of advice on how to navigate this class. Maybe a story of your own. Honestly anything helps. Thanks in advance.","So, Ive been on this sub for a bit. There are probably people who have seen some of the encouragements I gave.

"Like I said before I really honestly do wanna work, I want to have a career I really do. I know there's ODSP (disability) here in Canada but I honestly don't wanna be on disability and I didn't wanna be on it in the U.S.A but I don't know what choice I have. I don't know if I'll qualify for ODSP here either or be told again that I'm not severe enough. I hope I don't get turned down for Ontario Works, I need that assistance. As a kid and teenager since I'm female I was taught by my parents that all I'll be good for is cooking, cleaning, and making babies and that's it. I just don't want that to be true. Sometimes though I wonder if it's true and I get depressed wondering that (I do have medical depression, anxiety, and seasonal affective disorder.) I would like to graduate high school but need money for the courses to do that and right now since I'm living below the poverty line I don't have that money, I choose to spend whatever cash I get on food because it's nice to eat.","Like I said before I really honestly do wanna work, I want to have a career I really do.

"I guess Ill explain my situation. For about 3 months now Ive been talking to this girl. After our first date she said she didnt feel anything for me and so I tried to move on. After about a week of not talking to her she texted me asking how my day was. Since that day she started talking to me non stop every day. She then started to get kind of flirty and lead me on. When I talked to her about it, she said she was confused because she didnt feel anything originally and now she thinks things are changing. I was excited and so I just kept doing what I was doing and things were going great. Things went bad on Friday the 27th. The subject of our relationship status got brought up again and she said she was conflicted and part of her wants to just remain friends and part of her wants something more. I asked her if we could talk about it in person but we had to end up FaceTiming. It turns out all that flirting and leading on was her intentionally doing that to see if she was interested. What I took as affection turned out to be experimentation and at this point she was trying to avoid telling me the truth. Ive been rejected before but this one was different.","I guess Ill explain my situation. For about 3 months now Ive been talking to this girl.

"These past 4 days have been awful and I don't know what to do anymore. It all started on Thursday ( some context I'm 16) I got a call during school lunchtime that my best friend Jay(18) had been arrested for assault, he had beat his sister's  abusive boyfriend half to death so I'll probably never see him again but then an hour later I hear from my good friend John that my friend Mike(15) will be moving out of state because he got his girlfriend pregnant. Oh and not being able to see 2 of my friends wasn't enough I got pulled into the counselors office and told that I will be repeating earth science and that I will be taking a course over the summer. And on top of that my mom kicks me out of the house for 4 hours and I don't have a car so I get to bike in a rainstorm and when I'm finally allowed back in she tells me that I need to fuck off and stop being bad at school. It feels like my life is over and that I'm falling under and that I'm trapped if you have anything to say I'm all ears","These past 4 days have been awful and I don't know what to do anymore.

Hes staying with his Mom house in my hometown, so were living apart. We probably need to move back to my hometown after a year living hours away since our support system is there and since thats where my husbands team of doctors is based. My mom just died in March and because Im a contractor for my current job, they didnt pay me for the whole week and a half of work that I was out. So moneys been tight. I had to replace my tires recently. Work hasnt paid me back for my travel expenses. Now Im job hunting again and looking for new places to live. Im pretty broke, I cant visit my husband because the drive is so far and challenging and I only have less than 48 hours to make the trip. Im dealing with the loss of my mom, and how Im so unavailable because of my job, but I cant take a break from it because I wont get paid for it. Plus Im just feeling so shitty and unhappy with my body and Im just struggling so much. I know Ill be ok, but like...its just been bad day after bad day.

"Im a freshman in college and recently I moved about an hour away from home to attend school. The past few months have been absolutely dreadful, from moving in to an apartment to being late on rent every single month. My parents are separated so theyre always fighting over who should help me when money gets tight. Ive ran through about 3 jobs at my new location and cant seem to find the best job to keep me steady. I turn 20 literally on Friday and the fact that Im 20 with no stable income and barely getting by is killing my motivation and the way I want to handle things in life. I just feel like I have nothing going for me anymore. The only thing I can say Im motivated about is starting up my own kicking camp to teach high school football kickers the most important techniques and tips for training and in game situations. Besides that I cant find something to hold on to that would keep my head high and keep my motivation running. I just feel lost and empty and I wish I could ask for help but I know Ive already asked too many times. What are some tips you would have to keep a persons motivation running?","Im a freshman in college and recently I moved about an hour away from home to attend school.

"Tried to go back to warehouse work but the pain in my legs, feet, hips and back was excruciating. Only lasted 3 months. Husband was the bread winner and I did literally everything else. All he had to do was bring home a check. I scheduled appointments, paid bills, cleaned the house, planned meals, grocery shopped, etc. I was already doing that while also working. It was nice to only do one side of it. We bought a house. 1 month later my husband lost his job of 7 years. In the 2 years since, he has worked a total of 5 months. We cashed out his 401k. It lasted a year. I tried another call center. Cried so they let me go. We don't have the money for food, but Im trying to eat right and exercise anyways. Husband refuses to work. He won't clean. He won't talk to me about our future. He won't get his driver's license. Still wants sex though, even though it's painful to me and I need to see a gyno. Im happy he still wants me. Im afraid he will stop one day. Im still doing everything.","Tried to go back to warehouse work but the pain in my legs, feet, hips and back was excruciating. Only lasted 3 months.

"Hey, 18 F here. I have pretty bad anxiety and i finally got the courage to schedule my driver's test a few weeks ago. I studied my heart out, took 11 pages of notes on the driver's manual, and i thought i was ready. But I missed a stop sign and that's an automatic failure. I never even saw the damn thing because there was a tree branch in the way, and ended up missing a second one because I sort of went into a panicked state and shut down. When I parked and the lady told me a failed, i started bawling and I ended up crying all the way home and for a few hours after that. My dad (bless his heart) ended up having to call me out of work because when the time came around I was still crying and refused to get out of bed. Having a license is a really big thing for me because it's the next step in becoming completely independent and the bridge toward being able to finally quit my shitty job, move out, and get away from my kind of abusive mom.","Hey, 18 F here.

"I fear for my own future especially career wise. I do want to have a career in something that I love. Something that even on the worst of Monday's and even though it's very hard work I'll just love doing it. Unfortunately, I don't think I'll ever have that. I was born in Toronto Ontario Canada and I'm Autistic and as a child I was misdiagnosed and wasn't given the treatments and therapy I needed. I was put into a special class but it was for kids with ADHD which was what I was misdiagnosed with which I didn't have. Well, I never did well in school because I didn't get the help I needed. To make a long story short I just wasn't making my milestones or coming anywhere close to them so my parents pulled me out of school and homeschooled me. Now, when my parents homeschooled me there wasn't much information about it and not a whole lot of people did it, it just wasn't as common as it is now.","I fear for my own future especially career wise.

"I have been working since I was 14 (picking fruit on farms during the summer for 2 years) and on my own since 19 (I'm 32). I really hate relying on people and as this point I'm forced to because all my savings are gone. I come from a poorer family and they don't have money to share. I was so excited for the move because I honestly thought I had a great resume, and an awesome portfolio (for landscape design). I have reached out to the design companies in my area and never recieved a courtesy email back. I do have a lot of anxiety so cold calling, and calling back multiple times (especially when they have ignored me once) makes it super hard. I don't have a lot of people I can talk to because I don't want to bug my friends and family anymore. I'm always complaining about the same things... I am trying to find a therapist, but we only have coverage for maybe 2 or 3 visits. I'm trying to find someone who will work on a sliding scale because 2 visits isn't enough and I want to stick with the same person if I like them. Anyway. Not sure if this is in the right place.... Just needed to vent. TL DR: followed partner to city for his job... Quit mine...  can't find one. Now I'm jobless and sad.","I have been working since I was 14 (picking fruit on farms during the summer for 2 years) and on my own since 19 (I'm 32).

I informed his mother of the situation and he proceeded to angrier with me.&amp;#x200B;Incident 6Partner and I are relaxing by the swimming pool and his phone is being used to play music. It starts to get late so I collect all of his belongings and try to turn his pandora off when I noticed his phone was accessible. I do the unthinkable and start looking through his phone. I only did this because early in the day he was acting very strangely and purposefully start arguments with me out of thin air. I ask him whats going on and he protests that nothing is the matter. We take pictures but I just have this gut feeling about him because he is starting issues with me for no apparent reason. I go through his phone and find him talking to TWO other females and making plans to visit them and talking about my son with them. I get enraged and start verbally attacking him as soon as I see him. I say everything possible that was on my mind and more all in front of his family.,I informed his mother of the situation and he proceeded to angrier with me.&amp;#x200B;Incident 6Partner and I are relaxing by the swimming pool and his phone is being used to play music.

"At first, I wanted to voluntarily commit myself somewhere, so they began the process of finding a location with availability.

Trying to forget.My town has a decent school, so I applied and was accepted. Returning to school after ~10 years feels weird. Its a struggle, in fact. I went in feeling confident, but... something is wrong.

I feel like I peeked behind the curtain and cant return to reality in the same way. I can barely take care of myself. I dont *want* to take care of myself.

"Which airlines survive and which go on to thrive will largely depend on how successful individual countries economic support package turn out to beCovid-19 pandemic is such a fraught time for airlines because of the difficulty in predicting when the crisis will endThese are some excerpts from a recent article by some aviation experts. They discussed about the impact of Covid -19 on aviation sector throughout the world. Coming from an aviation background I can see how bleak the future might be. Any area for a favourable outcome during this time for aviation seems unlikely and we can see the effect on a large scale. Right from production factories to everyone related to aviation is under the devastating hand of the pandemic. Job losses, loan repayments, training halted midway are just some of the negative effects which Ive been witnessing in my little aviation circle. Personally, I have been quite tossed around by this turbulence in past too. I believe once you get into aviation you have to make up your mindset about facing such unprecedented times, as aviation is a cyclic industry a lot of factors come into play and the whole sector depends on these factors to work effectively. And Covid has uprooted these factors and brought it to a pause.During such times, one can lose their peace and its ripple effect can be seen in different ways. When we get comfortable at something we avoid going through the process of re-aligning to anything else. Because it takes away our peace and identity.","Which airlines survive and which go on to thrive will largely depend on how successful individual countries economic support package turn out to beCovid-19 pandemic is such a fraught time for airlines because of the difficulty in predicting when the crisis will endThese are some excerpts from a recent article by some aviation experts.

"So...Today I was planning on giving myself a pizza birthday with anyone who wanted to join on my campus. I only have two friends. I got a check for $100 yesterday that I cashed and I have been looking forward to this all week. Even after my birthday that happened this past Wednesday. I had some bills to pay like hulu and neflix which I didn't mind. But i made sure that I was saving enough to I could buy the stuff. I got on the bus. Got some drinks for myself and I got two bracelets from hot topic too but what I didn't realize was that most of my billing stuff happened today. So I went from $60 to $8 cause I didn't know my netflix bill and hulu bill happened today. So after I bought drinks and two cool bracelets for myself, I didn't have enough money to buy my pizzas. I was at target and I had put two digornio's stuffed cheese pizzas in my cart and I was trying to check my bank finances cause I always get paranoid that money is going to disappear. But I had $40 after I bought my bracelets.","So...Today I was planning on giving myself a pizza birthday with anyone who wanted to join on my campus. I only have two friends.

"Looks like the depression and disappointment hit me post midnight, as Im currently up at 5 am typing this. You know when only *one* small thing goes wrong then suddenly youre all up in a rut about every life decision youve made? Well, Im feeling really shitty about the fact that technically I allowed two things of my own possession to get slightly damaged, all in one night. Due to being lazy in bed, I asked my dad to shake my lava lamp to let the floating hardened liquid to sink towards the bottom. He shook it too hard, causing the whole thing to fall apart and for the lightbulb to lose one of its connector pieces. He said hed go to the hardware store soon to replace the lightbulb, but Im in slight doubt if the lamp will work after that, feeling that its my fault, in technical aspects. If I had simply gotten up to do it myself, then my lamp would have been fine. This is going to also sound ridiculous, but my new phone (no case, no screen protector) somehow slid off the surface I placed it on while doing something this late at night, causing it to hit the hard floor screen first, getting itself some small scratches on its corners in the process. I know the scratches arent that bad, but my obsessive compulsive disorder really tests my tolerance when it comes to the smallest things. And it was a new phone that Ive only had for a couple of weeks, for crying out loud! Why couldnt I have placed it on the floor or on the counter instead? Ive just been self deprecating for the past two hours, so far.In sum from all of this, how do I effectively diminish the thought of I could have done this to prevent this or that so I can learn from these small situations that have been bothering me for the past couple of hours? I guess I somehow have a compass as to how I can solve this, but hearing something from somebody else would really encourage me.","Looks like the depression and disappointment hit me post midnight, as Im currently up at 5 am typing this.

"We sat there talking about the possibilities for an hour straight.I got overwhelmed and needed to cool off in their bathroom. I was looking at myself in the mirror, and I could feel my brain pulsating and *moving*, like it was rewiring so rapidly that it was causing a physical sensation. Ive never felt anything like it.I suddenly felt enormous guilt. It was as if the universe was angry with me. I had opened Pandoras Box. I was this underaccomplished loser that barely achieved anything noteworthy in my life, always felt like a disappointment to my family, and here I had just stumbled across something that could change the world. I didnt deserve this, I hadnt worked for it at all, it was literally something I thought of while I was laying in bed after hitting the snooze button.That was the exact moment my psychotic break triggered. I became convinced that none of this was real. All an elaborate farce. My personal version of hell. I screamed and smashed my head against the mirror repeatedly. I had smashed through the medicine cabinet and wall behind it.","We sat there talking about the possibilities for an hour straight.I got overwhelmed and needed to cool off in their bathroom.

"My relationship with my mom has been a contentious one that has been brewing for a long time. I've been grappling with moving out, knowing full well she would never approve, and likely choose to disown me. A few days ago, we fought, and she gave me an ultimatum to move out by the end of the month. There's so much going on inside my mind - anxiety that our relationship will be irreparable, that this is a terrible and unsafe time to move (covid and right before the holidays), of whether I am good enough/mentally strong enough to live alone, if I will be able to find a place in time. Does it make the beast less terrible if I understand my beast? I'm deeply worried, and I'm hoping that someone can point me in the right direction and tell me about a time it all worked out for them.","My relationship with my mom has been a contentious one that has been brewing for a long time.

"I'm 19, I weigh 235 lb I used to be 250 at the beginning of the year, but it's really hard to keep exercising. Just today I was at the gym not 10 minutes ago and a couple of super skinny super hot girls just snickered at me. Part of it's probably because I'm paranoid but I feel like they were saying look at the fat girl trying to be like us Jesus Christ she doesn't f****** belong here. And so I ran home.

Just today I was at the gym not 10 minutes ago and a couple of super skinny super hot girls just snickered at me. Part of it's probably because I'm paranoid but I feel like they were saying look at the fat girl trying to be like us Jesus Christ she doesn't f****** belong here. And so I ran home.

"I failed my driver's test today. It is completely eating away at me, I feel so ashamed. I failed because I couldn't parallel park. I tried to practice beforehand but I didn't have a whole lot of time, it was all so rushed. I feel awful. I tried so hard and I feel like everyone is disappointed. When I mentioned it to people before hand I got ""it's super easy, you'll do great"" and then I failed and now I feel terrible. It seriously is making me sick rn. Everyone's response was just sorta ""oh that sucks"" The worst part about it is, I have made everything so much harder for my parents. They needed me to be an extra driver. And we're really tight right now but they paid the 50 bucks even though we were gonna have trouble affording it and I wasted it. I completely let them down and I feel sick to my stomach about it. They tried to hide it but I could tell that they were disappointed. I feel terrible. I've been beating myself up all day about it. I feel like an absolute failure.

"Hello, it's been a long-time secret hobby of mine to record myself playing instruments for fun, but i never had the guts to share my small projects with anyone close to me. Not a single soul. The thought itself is nerve-wracking for me.Early this year, I created a YT channel where I can start first by making covers before posting my own-----except that I am still too nervous to share it with others. There are a few views but from strangers, so it makes me less anxious that people do not know it is me. Just now, I did try sharing it with a few friends, who are still yet to respond. In the meantime, it's making my stomach churn.Generally, I think I am just scared of disappointing them.I know I need to let others hear my outputs because I need feedback to improve and grow.

"Ive been on a downward spiralMy fianc and I have moved in together at the start of 2020, which either highlighted or exposed some major dependency issues that she has. On top of that, her mental health has been beyond terrible for herwhich is likely a huge driving force for the dependencyand Ive gotten Caregivers Fatigue 3 or 4 times already. I desperately want to communicate this issue but she can already read it off of me (been together for a long time) which is making her mental health worse at times, and I think if we were to outright have that conversation it would cause her mental health to be even worse. She also gets upset that it seems like I view her as helpless and unable to function without me, and admittedly I do because shes so extremely needyI hate myself physically. Literally from my head to my toes: I cant find a good haircut and the barber that I helped out with that couldnt be consistent, then COVID hit and Im out a barber & reference point for my hair. Im in too low of a funk to consistently care about maintaining my beard which is as frustrating as daily care would be. Ive been gaining fat all of 2020 which not only do I want to lose weight but Im also a nutrition major so thats not a good look.","Ive been on a downward spiralMy fianc and I have moved in together at the start of 2020, which either highlighted or exposed some major dependency issues that she has.

"I am still in a bad predicament, though I know things can't stay here forever. I just wanted to ask you guys for some encouragement (and maybe some advice.) I have ALWAYS loved singing. When I was a young girl, I sang all the time. My family wasn't supportive. They're the kind that ALWAYS makes fun, even if you're good, because they're jokesters. When I got into school, I jumped into choir as soon as it was available to me. 6th grade. And I loved it so much. When I got to 7th grade, we moved to a new school and the choir teacher there was amazing. She encouraged me, and gave me more and more responsibility for my section and countless solos before adding me to her elite choir that went around and performed live at different places in our city. Even within that choir, she gave me solos and encouraged me. I felt confident and I loved to perform, even just blended into the choir. I loved it. I moved again in 9th grade. This choir teacher was awful. She did nothing but tear me down, hide me in the choir and ask me to be quiet.","I am still in a bad predicament, though I know things can't stay here forever.

I've wanted a masters for a long time with the idea that eventually I'd pursue a new career as a public policy analyst so I've gone back to undergraduate courses in economics and math with the idea if I do well I'll pursue a masters in economics but if not maybe public policy or political science or just go back to work.  Of note I'm married with a 6 moth old daughter.Well...I showed up to my first calculus test (I originally passed it with an 89.6 in 2002 but am retaking it to prepare for calculus II) and the teacher told us we couldn't use our calculators and to put them away. We all panic.  I didn't even finish the test.  Well, I just got back my grade and it's a 37/100 and I'm panicking thinking this was all a mistake quitting my career to go back to school just to try and find a career I was actually passionate about.

I'm really disheartened by my love life right now- every time I start to wind up pushing the boundaries of ""just friends"", when it's usually not even initiated by me at all, it falls apart when the guy ""isnt ready"" or (usually this is the case) afraid or something.

"Today was a great day. I spent the day at Chuck E. Cheese's with my mother, little brother, and my 3 nieces. Bro and I racked up 5,000+ tickets for the girls to spend on prizes. Came home and finished up NaNoWriMo, getting in all 50k words a day early, even though this month was rife with days so full of depression I wanted to just give up on it entirely and binge watch tv or play video games instead.So actually feeling a little bit more productive than usual. Then I get an email from my boss. So around November 14th, he tells me I need to ""pause"" work until December 5th due to some cash flow issues that he needs to straighten out. I'm not happy with this but I can't do anything about it because I work remotely from home as a contract employee. But today's email tells me that all of my accounts are being deactivated to ""save money"" and that he hopes the team can get up and functional again in January and he hopes I'll be part of the team then.So I'm essentially now unemployed for all of December which means Christmas is going to suck even more than usual, and I'm probably going to spend the next couple of weeks struggling with the heavier bouts of depression and anxiety again.I've been applying for jobs both remote and local for two months now and I haven't gotten anything, no bites at all. It's just really discouraging and I am losing all of my confidence, and maybe I thought reddit would have nice things to say to help cheer me up a little. Maybe this is the right subreddit for that.","Today was a great day. I spent the day at Chuck E. Cheese's with my mother, little brother, and my 3 nieces. Bro and I racked up 5,000+ tickets for the girls to spend on prizes. Came home and finished up NaNoWriMo, getting in all 50k words a day early, even though this month was rife with days so full of depression I wanted to just give up on it entirely and binge watch tv or play video games instead.So actually feeling a little bit more productive than usual.

"So I go into survival mode and wind back upstairs. During this time from Wednesday to Sunday, I am uncomfortable and nervous. I am under the impression that I''m allowed to leave by myself but not with my son. He finally agrees that the hurricane is no longer a threat and that I could go home. I did allow him to see my son, and try to co-parent like he wished but after picking up my son on Tuesday morning and experiencing how my partner was still being aggressive with me, I finally realized how my emotional and physical safety was at risk.I called the police and reported the domestic dispute and he was eventually arrested and forced to do anger management.&amp;#x200B;After everything had happened, I decided to reconnect with him and try again. I knew this was a bad idea, but I wanted a family and I wanted my son to grow up with family. BIG MISTAKE. As soon as this happened, day by day, my partner was showing his true colors again.","So I go into survival mode and wind back upstairs.

"I get up to flee, slip and hit my face on the ground. I try to go and get my son he blocks me from doing so. I end up getting my son and running out of the apartment. I walk up the sidewalk a little bit to calm down and when I return to my car he is blocking my driver side door. I ask him to move several times and he refuses. I tell him if he didn't move I was going to call the cops. He snatches my phone and tells me that I'm not. It was evident that he was not going to allow me to leave.","I get up to flee, slip and hit my face on the ground. I try to go and get my son he blocks me from doing so.

"Sorry for formatting or mistakes, im on my phone and currently crying in the bathroom over first year university calculus, i opened up a ""quiz"" (can be tried as many times until we've gotten over 75% to unlock the current weeks videos) and i just exited out because the first question had me stumped.  I havent done the homework yet, and I know that this isn't the way to go, i should havd done homework first to guage how well i know the material before stressing.  But I've had this mental block all day, and just this mental block in general that I can't actually be confident in my math skills.  And i always have this self doubt.  I just have thus idea that I can never be smart in all things math, I'm trying to have a growth mindset but its so hard.  I know that i have to put the work in to understanding math, and im going to try, but right after im done crying.  I just needed to say it as a stranger online since i don't have anyone to tell in real life, i dont want to put this all on my friends because I did that last night. And if im like this during the first year how will i handle the rest?During the summer i had the expectation that i would do better this year, but in already drained, I dont want to go throug mh 4 years of this.  If anyone has any advice, or comforting words or experience they could share, that would be nice.","Sorry for formatting or mistakes, im on my phone and currently crying in the bathroom over first year university calculus, i opened up a ""quiz"" (can be tried as many times until we've gotten over 75% to unlock the current weeks videos) and i just exited out because the first question had me stumped.

"I know it's been hard thanks for doing your best."" You criticize me over something so menial. So, I quit. I called my manager explained to him how I have been giving it my all, and it doesn't seem to be enough for these two and despite my coming to you about this on multiple occasions it's not improved, so I'm leaving. I gathered my things told my coworkers I was clocking out and left.I'm at a point now, where I've never done this before. I've always had something else lined up. It's a bit scary, but I do have some money saved and support from my bf, friends, and family if needed. Still it feels crazy to bet on myself for once and not settle for a job just because it's a job. I want to pursue my passion, which is ultimately to help people live better lives. I don't want to be a personal trainer forever it just seems like a good jumping off point with how much I already incorporate it into my personal life.All I know is that I want better for myself and I want to help people better themselves as well.Have any of you done this before? What did you learn? Any advice/encouragement?","I know it's been hard thanks for doing your best."" You criticize me over something so menial. So, I quit.

"im 19, ive been arrested twice for marijuana. once when I was 17 and then again when I was 18, it was over a year ago and im still going to court for it. yesterday I sat in the court room for almost 5 hours just for them to give me another court date. I broke down and started ugly crying in front of the prosecutor. it was so frustrating. I went to rehab in april. I was bad off on xanax and I overdosed. but it was on purpose. my dad kicked me out, so I moved in with my great aunt. shes nice. but I dont feel like I can talk to her. I got a new job, but I had to quit because the dish guy was harassing me. it got to the point where I was terrified to go into work and all they told me was to just leave him alone. so I quit. every time something good happens 10 bad things happen. I wrecked my car and I have a rental car now, but whatever money the insurance gives me my dad is just gonna use to pay off the car that I wrecked. so getting a new car is on me and I have no money. no job. im getting really fucking tired of this shit. all my friends do drugs so I pretty much lost all of them when I got out of rehab. ive stayed clean for the most part, ive only drank and smoked weed a handful of times. i has a job interview today but I couldnt go because I didnt have enough gas in my car. i just want a fucking break.","im 19, ive been arrested twice for marijuana. once when I was 17 and then again when I was 18, it was over a year ago and im still going to court for it. yesterday I sat in the court room for almost 5 hours just for them to give me another court date.

To be able to scream loudly in the car or use all my paint just to draw something dumb. I would give up my life for some childish enjoyment.Even now, i have a hard time finding ways to feel alive, even if I've given up things like talent,, and the fear of being alone still haunts me every time i open my mouth to sing or pick up a pen to draw,, but i want everyone to remember something,,,Don't give up your happiness for approval.

"Ive been on a downward spiralMy fianc and I have moved in together at the start of 2020, which either highlighted or exposed some major dependency issues that she has. On top of that, her mental health has been beyond terrible for herwhich is likely a huge driving force for the dependencyand Ive gotten Caregivers Fatigue 3 or 4 times already. I desperately want to communicate this issue but she can already read it off of me (been together for a long time) which is making her mental health worse at times, and I think if we were to outright have that conversation it would cause her mental health to be even worse. She also gets upset that it seems like I view her as helpless and unable to function without me, and admittedly I do because shes so extremely needyI hate myself physically. Literally from my head to my toes: I cant find a good haircut and the barber that I helped out with that couldnt be consistent, then COVID hit and Im out a barber & reference point for my hair. Im in too low of a funk to consistently care about maintaining my beard which is as frustrating as daily care would be. Ive been gaining fat all of 2020 which not only do I want to lose weight but Im also a nutrition major so thats not a good look.","Ive been on a downward spiralMy fianc and I have moved in together at the start of 2020, which either highlighted or exposed some major dependency issues that she has.

"Blood everywhere. Its left a couple scars. Im lucky Im not blind.I dont want to tell you the whole story it would take a long time to recount all the details and a lot of it was just madness. I feel compelled to mention that I was begging my friends to get a gun and shoot me. I grabbed my friend by the hair and said terrible things to him (were no longer friends). The police came, and I was delirious but not combative, since I had collapsed. During the ambulance ride and for several hours afterwards I was hearing voices. My legs and arms were cuffed to a bed for the entire night. They position you in a certain uncomfortable position so you cant reach your hands close enough together to grab/use anything. I was so convinced that this was Hell, that I used my teeth to pull a cord coming from a nearby monitor and wrapped it around my neck to try to strangle myself.My sense of time became massively warped. It felt like I was in that hospital for 300 years. I eventually calmed down enough that they actually approved to release me.","Blood everywhere. Its left a couple scars.

"Hi, I'm pretty new here on Reddit. Anyway, I've been really sick for about a week now. Because of it, I've mostly been staying at home.My best friend regularly texts me from school and cheers me up. We have a really great relationship and almost never argue with each other)But today, she texted me out of nowhere, saying that ""I wish I were in your place"", and kept talking about how I had it easy and how stressed she was, unlike me.I was honestly really surprised, considering she knew how bad the pains from my illness are. I told her that my position is not perfect either and that I didn't wish her the pain I had. In the end she lashed out at me. I felt really bad and tried to apologize, but she is mostly ignoring me. I won't see her in person for another 3 days.I've been really stressed about this for the past few hours, and I can't help but feel guilty about it, even right now. With my self esteem and social anxiety issues, it is only getting worse. Can anyone please cheer me up a bit and give me some advice on how to properly apologize to her when I'll meet her again?Thanks in advance, and apologies for any mistakes in the post)","Hi, I'm pretty new here on Reddit.

"I [19F] just broke up with my boyfriend [22M] I am heartbroken and lost. I met him a couple months ago and I fell so hard and so fast for him. Now I dont have anything. I knew he was the one, I knew he would be the one who I would marry and be there till the end. I have messed up so bad and theres nothing I can do. I feel so hopeless.. I lost my soulmate, he was and still is my everything. I dont wanna live my life without him. I cant keep dealing with heartbreak. This has happened too many times. I cant do it. When Im heartbroken I get really bad depression. Im taking medicine for it but it still hurts. For once can I be treated right.. do I not deserve anything good in my life? Am I not deserving of love? Is there something wrong with me? Am I unloving.. I need encouragement that its gonna be okay because I have no one else.. Please help me.","I [19F] just broke up with my boyfriend [22M] I am heartbroken and lost. I met him a couple months ago and I fell so hard and so fast for him. Now I dont have anything.

"I just had a rather horrid binge, and this has been a problem Ive been dealing with ever since childhood. Its hard for me to be kind to myself after I decided to stuff my face to the point of getting sick instead of looking after myself. Does anyone have kind words to offer?

"Blood everywhere. Its left a couple scars. Im lucky Im not blind.I dont want to tell you the whole story it would take a long time to recount all the details and a lot of it was just madness. I feel compelled to mention that I was begging my friends to get a gun and shoot me. I grabbed my friend by the hair and said terrible things to him (were no longer friends). The police came, and I was delirious but not combative, since I had collapsed. During the ambulance ride and for several hours afterwards I was hearing voices. My legs and arms were cuffed to a bed for the entire night. They position you in a certain uncomfortable position so you cant reach your hands close enough together to grab/use anything. I was so convinced that this was Hell, that I used my teeth to pull a cord coming from a nearby monitor and wrapped it around my neck to try to strangle myself.My sense of time became massively warped. It felt like I was in that hospital for 300 years. I eventually calmed down enough that they actually approved to release me.","Blood everywhere. Its left a couple scars.

"I have been working since I was 14 (picking fruit on farms during the summer for 2 years) and on my own since 19 (I'm 32). I really hate relying on people and as this point I'm forced to because all my savings are gone. I come from a poorer family and they don't have money to share. I was so excited for the move because I honestly thought I had a great resume, and an awesome portfolio (for landscape design). I have reached out to the design companies in my area and never recieved a courtesy email back. I do have a lot of anxiety so cold calling, and calling back multiple times (especially when they have ignored me once) makes it super hard. I don't have a lot of people I can talk to because I don't want to bug my friends and family anymore. I'm always complaining about the same things... I am trying to find a therapist, but we only have coverage for maybe 2 or 3 visits. I'm trying to find someone who will work on a sliding scale because 2 visits isn't enough and I want to stick with the same person if I like them. Anyway. Not sure if this is in the right place.... Just needed to vent. TL DR: followed partner to city for his job... Quit mine...  can't find one. Now I'm jobless and sad.","I have been working since I was 14 (picking fruit on farms during the summer for 2 years) and on my own since 19 (I'm 32).

"I'm so lost. I moved back home (3 states away) to move in with my brother (and his wife and toddler) when my previous job stopped paying the bills. I was told to take my time, do what's right for me, and not to leave until I actually had money in savings again. I am taking a computer course that ends in an apprenticeship in June/July. I have a waitressing job 4 days a week. The money has fallen to $60/shift in tips plus a paltry $4/hr. It's a daytime waitressing position, as I have the tendency to become extremely unproductive during the day and drink to excess when I'm off at 10pm or later. It's happened countless times.Beyond that, I find it nearly impossible to live with a stranger. The last two roommates I have had that I didn't really know have ended badly. This is why I moved in with my brother and his family. I babysit with little to no advance notice a few times a week (for free of course). I try to stay in my room and not make a mess. I try to get up with my niece and let my brother and sister sleep in when I am able. I haven't even been there 6 months.","I'm so lost.

I just quit a job I loved and I've started at my new place.  They're really different but my old boss was abusive and careless to his employees and I couldn't take it anymore.  I went back to a place I had worked before and I also love it for different reasons.  I'm 28 and I haven't found a solid career.  My new job has offered to pay for classes to get my LTP as I work at a tax firm.  It's really tempting because I would get to stay here with people I love and the pay would be great but my old job was working with kids which i love more.  I want to continue working with kids but I would need to go back to school to have jobs that pay enough.I have anxiety and all of this change and stress has been getting to me.  I haven't cleaned my apartment in weeks.  My husband and I currently live in a low income apartment building which doesn't allow for full student households.  He is in school and if I take classes we would have to find another place to live.  All of this is stressing me out so much and my husband is stressed out and checked out.  I need anyone to talk to but I'm afraid to talk to my friends about this.  When I talk to my husband he doesn't say much.  I just need even a shred of support from anyone because the person I need it from the most is not in an emotional or mental place to give that.,I just quit a job I loved and I've started at my new place.

"I've been unemployed since January, basically fired from a great job I had for a few months. I've applied to jobs online and went to a temp agency but nothing has resulted in work. i don't have health insurance and my savings are being depleted. I have kept my unemployment hush hush, but I've heard that talking to people in your network can help you land a job. I've created a list of 6 ppl I can reach out to to talk about finding employment and support in my future endeavors (going to grad school). I am full of anxiety that what I say won't make sense, no one will want to help me, my lack of follow through will jeopardize things, if I get a job through this I'll fuck that up too, etc. Asking for help feels like an excruciating slow death. Sometimes I think it'd be easier just to kill myself. Normally, I'd rather have my teeth pulled than ask for help and be vulnerable, but if I don't do anything I'll have to move back in with my parents (I'm not sure I can survive that and it wouldn't be easy to do b/c of their own issues). But there's also the very real fear that I do all this and still get no work (but then I'd just look for some minimum wage gigs, but even those have not been easy to get and I have loans to pay). I'm thinking about reaching out to everyone on the list in a blaze of motivation. Can I get some encouragement, a little pep talk?","I've been unemployed since January, basically fired from a great job I had for a few months.

"Looks like the depression and disappointment hit me post midnight, as Im currently up at 5 am typing this. You know when only *one* small thing goes wrong then suddenly youre all up in a rut about every life decision youve made? Well, Im feeling really shitty about the fact that technically I allowed two things of my own possession to get slightly damaged, all in one night. Due to being lazy in bed, I asked my dad to shake my lava lamp to let the floating hardened liquid to sink towards the bottom. He shook it too hard, causing the whole thing to fall apart and for the lightbulb to lose one of its connector pieces. He said hed go to the hardware store soon to replace the lightbulb, but Im in slight doubt if the lamp will work after that, feeling that its my fault, in technical aspects. If I had simply gotten up to do it myself, then my lamp would have been fine. This is going to also sound ridiculous, but my new phone (no case, no screen protector) somehow slid off the surface I placed it on while doing something this late at night, causing it to hit the hard floor screen first, getting itself some small scratches on its corners in the process. I know the scratches arent that bad, but my obsessive compulsive disorder really tests my tolerance when it comes to the smallest things. And it was a new phone that Ive only had for a couple of weeks, for crying out loud! Why couldnt I have placed it on the floor or on the counter instead? Ive just been self deprecating for the past two hours, so far.In sum from all of this, how do I effectively diminish the thought of I could have done this to prevent this or that so I can learn from these small situations that have been bothering me for the past couple of hours? I guess I somehow have a compass as to how I can solve this, but hearing something from somebody else would really encourage me.","Looks like the depression and disappointment hit me post midnight, as Im currently up at 5 am typing this.

"Today was a great day. I spent the day at Chuck E. Cheese's with my mother, little brother, and my 3 nieces. Bro and I racked up 5,000+ tickets for the girls to spend on prizes. Came home and finished up NaNoWriMo, getting in all 50k words a day early, even though this month was rife with days so full of depression I wanted to just give up on it entirely and binge watch tv or play video games instead.So actually feeling a little bit more productive than usual. Then I get an email from my boss. So around November 14th, he tells me I need to ""pause"" work until December 5th due to some cash flow issues that he needs to straighten out. I'm not happy with this but I can't do anything about it because I work remotely from home as a contract employee. But today's email tells me that all of my accounts are being deactivated to ""save money"" and that he hopes the team can get up and functional again in January and he hopes I'll be part of the team then.So I'm essentially now unemployed for all of December which means Christmas is going to suck even more than usual, and I'm probably going to spend the next couple of weeks struggling with the heavier bouts of depression and anxiety again.I've been applying for jobs both remote and local for two months now and I haven't gotten anything, no bites at all. It's just really discouraging and I am losing all of my confidence, and maybe I thought reddit would have nice things to say to help cheer me up a little. Maybe this is the right subreddit for that.","Today was a great day. I spent the day at Chuck E. Cheese's with my mother, little brother, and my 3 nieces.

"I pulled on my thick long-sleeve shirt and held the corset over my head. I fought to put it on by myself for a minute or so before it fell seamlessly down my chest and over my torso.Ladies, gentlemen, and those who can't make up their minds, I'm happy to say that I can finally wear the article of clothing I was afraid of wearing most. Still wearing it even as I type! I couldn't possibly feel any more proud of the progress I'm making, but I know I'm not done yet. I'll post more milestones as they come. Small victories today for a healthier tomorrow. UPDATE (1 June, 2019) : After months of continual effort and self-discipline, I can now wear size 12 jeans again! My mother gave me a bag of her assorted hand-me-downs, which included three pairs of jeans. Compared to the 16-18s I wore at the start of the year, I'm feeling exceptionally proud of myself. My face looks thinner in the mirror, too!","I pulled on my thick long-sleeve shirt and held the corset over my head.

"I'm in a job position I have no experience in making a lot more than I deserve. It's a very technical and specialized position that I have absolutely no business being in. My boss liked me so I was promoted to this three months ago despite knowing fuck all what I was doing. Since then, I feel like I've done okay. Like I get the job done day to day but it's more like I know what to do, not why I'm doing it like that. My only resource for questions is a forum for this particular type of work for this franchise. It's the only one of it's kind. That's all I have. Anytime I have a question, that's practically my only resource short of toiling through thousands of pages of policy documentation to find what I need. Today I asked a question on the forum for clarification and was completely humiliated for it. Several people that have been doing this 10-20 years were mocking me over it, cracking jokes about how my company is fucked with me in this position and how clueless I was. Some people came to my defense and encouraged me to keep asking questions but the people mocking me were the ""hot shot"" posters. Big names of very seasoned respected employees. I felt humiliated and alone. I feel like I can't go there anymore to ask questions, and without that, I'm lost. I do not have the capacity to read thousands and thousands of pages of documentation and policy and study them and learn then by heart. I'm lost. I feel like without that, I don't have the ability to succeed. It's well past my bedtime and I can't sleep because of this.","I'm in a job position I have no experience in making a lot more than I deserve.

"Feeling very hopeless. Followed my partner to a big city for his job, quit mine, thought I would find work quick. It's been almost 6 months. I have no more savings, we have his income and health benefits now, but we are still struggling on one income.I have had a few interviews and I never get a call back. I have applied at some clothing stores, too, but they don't even call me for an interview. I am looking for a career, though, not a part-time job. I have also applied for key holders, reception, teaching (I have a TEFL certificate) , in theatre (I have a degree), but there are no call backs for me. I have 7 years landscaping with 2 of those as supervisor, and 1 being on my own. I don't have a degree in landscape design (just experience) nor do I have a florist certificate (which I am getting but it does cost almost 3300 CAD). I have had 2 interviews with a floral shop and a few via email and they always ghost me when they ask to see photos. I have tons of experience from landscaping making planters for all seasons. I also understand variety, textures, colours etc I am just bogged down by no one giving me a chance. I built a bouquet at an interview and she said she was so impressed, and despite telling me she'd call back, she just ghosted me. I know we are a couple, but I hate using his money for things I want/ need.","Feeling very hopeless. Followed my partner to a big city for his job, quit mine, thought I would find work quick.

"I have a tough time connecting with my dad (mom died 18 months ago).  I am on the fence about whether my husband and I should really be together.  Sometimes I would rather be by myself and my thoughts than other people.  Sometimes my internal monologue is just really negative.  Sometimes it just seems like too much to call a friend.  Problem is, I have a son and I know I need to open up and show him how a person can connect.  I don't really know where I need to go but I wish the guys from Queer eye could come and just fix my life in a week.  I guess I just have to do that for myself.  I think I need to force myself to go out and talk to other people and do things to bring me in to connection with the world.  I just feel like hiding under a blanket for the rest of my life.

"Hoo boy. Feeling vomit ahead. So, I'm in my last year of college after failing out a few years prior due to a major depressive spiral, and not realizing I needed some major changes in my life. I've made it this far, but yet I am feeling very panicked. I'm struggling with my finance course (I am not a math/numbers guy in the least) and my microeconomics course. I have lowered my expectations from doing well in the class to passing the class. This isn't what I want. I want to succeed and do well, but halfway through I fall down and stumble my way through the rest of the course. I've already put myself a semester behind schedule because of this. I'm so close but I am dealing with a lot of pressure as well. I can't afford (literally) to push anything back another semester as I am maxing out on federal student aid after this year. I have two courses to take over the summer that will finish my degree (assuming this and the next semester go well enough) and I have no idea how I am going to pay for them, as one is a costly short-term study abroad that I am pretty much pigeon-holed into taking. I feel like a failure for not finishing my degree the first time, and for getting myself into this whole mess by wasting money like crazy that last year at my previous institution among other things. I'm mad at myself for letting myself fall down like this. I'm mad at myself for not learning the first time that I need to be more proactive on things. Gah.Sorry for the feeling vomit. If you made it through all that, congrats, and here's a towel to wipe off the feeling vomit. ","Hoo boy. Feeling vomit ahead.

For 4 years I have been dating a high functioning autistic woman. (30) She lived with her parents for the entire duration. Recently her father quit his job because he couldnt take a vacation the days he wanted to.Within 3 days of hearing this story I was informed they would be moving across the state and that she would be going with them. Note at this time we had plans for marriage and had a great relationship.Today she ended our relationship. Her reasons where not her own they were the exact parrotings of her parents far right wing conservatives note that I am not white or conservative. We never let this affect anything or even talk about it. 3 months ago I had open heart surgery at 29. I now noticed since then things have gone downhill.Long story short she made me feel used worthless and broken. That I dont have my life together and cannot be a Provider. But I know these are not her words. Unfortunately nothing I say will bring her back. I just need some assurance Im not those things she said.

All of this timing is so bad and every day the few things ive been able to do to take care of myself have been eating healthy, going a run, and doing a tiny bit of homework, as well as spending tons of time on the advice subreddit trying to help others.

I had to replace my tires recently. Work hasnt paid me back for my travel expenses. Now Im job hunting again and looking for new places to live. Im pretty broke, I cant visit my husband because the drive is so far and challenging and I only have less than 48 hours to make the trip. Im dealing with the loss of my mom, and how Im so unavailable because of my job, but I cant take a break from it because I wont get paid for it. Plus Im just feeling so shitty and unhappy with my body and Im just struggling so much. I know Ill be ok, but like...its just been bad day after bad day. Im a very positive person and have been handling this well, but Im having a spiral moment. Advice, encouragement and positivity are welcome. Thanks Reddit."
"I struggle with depression and so sometimes getting up and out of bed or reminding myself to eat feels like the most difficult thing to do, so I'd like to be able to look back to this post and its comments for that extra bit of push whenever those days come. I know it's easy to fake optimism, but I don't have anyone to go to so anything is appreciated.

"So, I really want to start up taking acting classes as I've always wanted to act, like really badly. There are plenty of teenage classes near where I live that I would love to try out but I don't have anybody to go with. Acting classes feel like a thing where people would definitely bring a friend along to help them feel less awkward and so i'm sure that everyone in the classes will have at least one person that they know.The problem I have is that none of my friends are remotely interested in acting and wouldn't join the classes with me. I'm trying to get the courage to go alone but right now i'm way too scared to sign up. Any advice on how to not be such a wimp or how to find a friend that likes acting? If it helps i'm 14F Originally posted on r/advice but not getting responses Any advice is appreciated, have a great day!","So, I really want to start up taking acting classes as I've always wanted to act, like really badly.

It took me awhile to figure this out but i have a fear of things working out too well for me due to superstitions (like it falling apart ) or just doing so well that i have responsibilities that i cant handle. And it holds me back SO much that i dont wanna leave my comfort zone of doing the same boring things every day even though i hate it so much..Some encouragement or advice would be wonderful:) thanks in advance,It took me awhile to figure this out but i have a fear of things working out too well for me due to superstitions (like it falling apart ) or just doing so well that i have responsibilities that i cant handle.

Suicide has dimmed the light of joy and peace in so many individuals and brought guilt and suffering to those who are staying behind.Suicide has finally made it on my top list of the ugliest words in human history alongside abuse, violence, rape, and bullying.Why should you voluntarily end your life?

Why shouldnt you if there is no reason, and joy to live?, they would tell me.To all those out there who are considering or thinking of suicide, I am sorry to tell you that  suicide is simply a permanent solution to a temporary problem.

"Some background: I work inventory for a website that sells trading cards, and I've been mildly crushing on a coworker for awhile now. She's nice, funny, quiet, shy, cute, and from the little bit we've interacted she seems like an interesting person. We haven't interacted much outside of passing conversation because I'm also a pretty quiet and shy person, so the few times I've had the chance I've never been able to think of a way to interact with her without it seeming very forced or making it awkward for one or both of us. The crush level has gone up recently because she got me a cheesecake platter for my birthday. Not an unusual thing as she's always bringing in cookies for everyone but it made my day all the same. I've got the chance to return the favor, but it's not under quite the best of circumstances; She's got a surgery scheduled for this week, and while it's not major she's said she's still really scared (Can't blame her). Add in her having a bout of the flu and she's been in a pretty bad place the last few weeks.I decided to get her something to cheer her up and settled on making her cannoli (I saw from a FB post of hers that she liked it) and spent the last few days carefully finding out her favorite flavors and any food allergies she may have without directly asking her.","Some background: I work inventory for a website that sells trading cards, and I've been mildly crushing on a coworker for awhile now.

"I am studying to get a bachelors degree and currently have a month of examinations in my school and I am beyond tired. I am also working 24 hours per week at job so I could live on my own, pay the bills, pay for food. Not a dream job, but it pays the bills. Tommorow I have an exam in a subject that I was not attending for almost half a semester because being there in lectures is just as useless as just not being there. (Was doing other homework in the meantime though, so suppose it was more useful to not be there in the end). About this particular subject I am completely clueless and I should gather my strengths today so I could get past 'fail' tommorow. But I just want to be lazy for once so badly !  I want to do something for my personal goals, I want to spend some more time with my boyfriend, I want to meet my mom, I want a whole day just at home. I like my studies because it is finally something I am very much interested in (except tomorrows exam, but it's only a small part of everything). Still it is hard. I wrote myself a letter in the beginning in autumn that was delivered to my during this hard time of exams. I had forgotten about it and I was very moved when I received it. My past self says that she hopes that I am just as inspired as she is at the moment and hopes I am getting enough rest and she is very proud of me. The last part is the one that moved me so much, I think I just don't get enough reassurement that I am doing enough. I should not be depending on other's peoples reassurement though, but my own, is it not right? But I am soo busy and sad","I am studying to get a bachelors degree and currently have a month of examinations in my school and I am beyond tired.

Tommorow I have an exam in a subject that I was not attending for almost half a semester because being there in lectures is just as useless as just not being there. (Was doing other homework in the meantime though, so suppose it was more useful to not be there in the end). About this particular subject I am completely clueless and I should gather my strengths today so I could get past 'fail' tommorow. But I just want to be lazy for once so badly !  I want to do something for my personal goals, I want to spend some more time with my boyfriend, I want to meet my mom, I want a whole day just at home. I like my studies because it is finally something I am very much interested in (except tomorrows exam, but it's only a small part of everything). Still it is hard. I wrote myself a letter in the beginning in autumn that was delivered to my during this hard time of exams. I had forgotten about it and I was very moved when I received it. My past self says that she hopes that I am just as inspired as she is at the moment and hopes I am getting enough rest and she is very proud of me. The last part is the one that moved me so much, I think I just don't get enough reassurement that I am doing enough. I should not be depending on other's peoples reassurement though, but my own, is it not right? But I am soo busy and sad"
"I dreamed of being a lawyer or having my own business and owning a corporation. I dreamed of so many things. Now I'm applying to work in fast food and janitorial jobs. Not what I dreamed of or anywhere near it and I'm not getting those jobs either, they keep asking for experience and a high school diploma. Even the fast food joints are doing that, which I think is stupid. What experience does someone need in order to ask the question ""do you want fries with that?"" Anyways, please give me some encouragement for my future. Something to give me hope that I can still achieve my dreams of being independent and having a fulfilling career.","I dreamed of being a lawyer or having my own business and owning a corporation.

"Looks like the depression and disappointment hit me post midnight, as Im currently up at 5 am typing this. You know when only *one* small thing goes wrong then suddenly youre all up in a rut about every life decision youve made? Well, Im feeling really shitty about the fact that technically I allowed two things of my own possession to get slightly damaged, all in one night. Due to being lazy in bed, I asked my dad to shake my lava lamp to let the floating hardened liquid to sink towards the bottom. He shook it too hard, causing the whole thing to fall apart and for the lightbulb to lose one of its connector pieces. He said hed go to the hardware store soon to replace the lightbulb, but Im in slight doubt if the lamp will work after that, feeling that its my fault, in technical aspects. This is going to also sound ridiculous, but my new phone (no case, no screen protector) somehow slid off the surface I placed it on while doing something this late at night, causing it to hit the hard floor screen first, getting itself some small scratches on its corners in the process. I know the scratches arent that bad, but my obsessive compulsive disorder really tests my tolerance when it comes to the smallest things. And it was a new phone that Ive only had for a couple of weeks, for crying out loud! Ive just been self deprecating for the past two hours, so far.In sum from all of this, how do I effectively diminish the thought of I could have done this to prevent this or that so I can learn from these small situations that have been bothering me for the past couple of hours? I guess I somehow have a compass as to how I can solve this, but hearing something from somebody else would really encourage me.","Looks like the depression and disappointment hit me post midnight, as Im currently up at 5 am typing this.

"Tried to go back to warehouse work but the pain in my legs, feet, hips and back was excruciating. Only lasted 3 months. Husband was the bread winner and I did literally everything else. All he had to do was bring home a check. I scheduled appointments, paid bills, cleaned the house, planned meals, grocery shopped, etc. I was already doing that while also working. It was nice to only do one side of it. We bought a house. 1 month later my husband lost his job of 7 years. In the 2 years since, he has worked a total of 5 months. We cashed out his 401k. It lasted a year. I tried another call center. Cried so they let me go. We don't have the money for food, but Im trying to eat right and exercise anyways. Husband refuses to work. He won't clean. He won't talk to me about our future. He won't get his driver's license. Still wants sex though, even though it's painful to me and I need to see a gyno. Im happy he still wants me. Im afraid he will stop one day. Im still doing everything.","Tried to go back to warehouse work but the pain in my legs, feet, hips and back was excruciating. Only lasted 3 months.

"I need some help. I'm having a lot of trouble mentally and don't want to burden friends and family with my issues. I don't want to burden anyone really. But I guess strangers are better in this scenario. Lately, I don't want to be here anymore. I don't necessarily want to kill myself persay just not exist. I'm feeling like a complete failure and that the world would be better off if I wasn't in it. I'm not remarkable. I'm not going to change the world (although that's what I thought I was suppose to do). At best I will live an average normal existence. I hate that in order to even remotely be alright I have to take medication for the rest of my life. Anxiety and depression overwhelm my life.

Sometimes, every so often, I am actually happy. I think. But the demons always come back. I'm so tired of living this way. It effects every facet of my live. I've lost jobs, friends, relationships etc. It seems the only way to keep the demons away is to just cease to be here.  I've had another fairly bad episode this past week and I'm worried about my job. I'm worried about what my coworkers think. I'm worried about pretty much everything to be honest. The list is endless.

"I recently finished a BSc in biology (the thought-process was to start off in biology, and segway into vet-school after a couple of years). I ended up changing my mind about vet-school pretty early into my bachelor's, and that's when I started thinking about changing my major to something artsy (I had always had a passion for writing). What stopped me from doing that was the unintentional (at least, I think it was) pressure my family and relatives put on me; out of all 6 grandchildren, I was the only one who was doing significantly well in university; my two older cousins both dropped out of their undergrad after about 5 weeks, because they couldn't cope with the level of difficulty (I'm not in any way throwing shade, people can choose to do whatever they want in their lives and I honestly couldn't give less of a flying fig). Anyway, I was continuously being flooded with words of encouragement from my relatives, and they very quickly stopped calling me by my name, and instead started calling me ""the biologist"". And, although the encouragement made me feel good about myself, I couldn't help but start to feel trapped in my academic path: ""I'm the only one of the grandchildren who's academically inclined, the others have shown absolutely no interest in pursuing a university degree...Hell, they've nicknamed me 'the biologist', I can't stop now, I'll surely let everybody down"". So, I finished my biology degree (nothing fancy, no co-op, no job waiting for me when I graduated, nothing), but now I've been thinking about getting a Master's in literature, or fine arts, or English (in about 3 years). I'm still scared that I would be making a stupid mistake by choosing a MA instead of a MSc, and that I would regret it, especially since I don't even believe my writing is that good.","I recently finished a BSc in biology (the thought-process was to start off in biology, and segway into vet-school after a couple of years).

"Hey guys,I just need some major encouragement. After like a month of struggling and some really hurtful things said, my girlfriend of 3.7ish years broke up with me. This sunday is kind of like closure for us, I mean I want it to be an open conversation, and just be honest and loving towards each other as just human decency, but she's just turned on me so fast. Like, just how she talks to me and how she thinks I'm annoying. Just last weekend I went up to see her at her school via train for 3 hours and that's when she ended it with me. I'm afraid that if I let her go fully, I'll never have hope in finding someone else, or that I won't be able to love again.

It's been going on to varying degrees now for the last 20 years.  I've been everywhere from comatose on antianxieties to agoraphobic to disgusting because I can't even handle basic hygiene. Sometimes, every so often, I am actually happy. I think. But the demons always come back. I'm so tired of living this way. It effects every facet of my live. I've lost jobs, friends, relationships etc. It seems the only way to keep the demons away is to just cease to be here.  I've had another fairly bad episode this past week and I'm worried about my job. I'm worried about what my coworkers think. I'm worried about pretty much everything to be honest. The list is endless. I guess what I'm asking is for some comforting words of encouragement that everything won't implode and even if it does it won't always be that way."
Im stressed and partly because I had a lot of family stuff going on this week. But its midterm week and now I gave this test Im not 100% ready for. I just need encouragement thats all  thank you in advance.,Im stressed and partly because I had a lot of family stuff going on this week.

"I'm 19, I weigh 235 lb I used to be 250 at the beginning of the year, but it's really hard to keep exercising. Just today I was at the gym not 10 minutes ago and a couple of super skinny super hot girls just snickered at me. Part of it's probably because I'm paranoid but I feel like they were saying look at the fat girl trying to be like us Jesus Christ she doesn't f****** belong here. And so I ran home. I don't know if I can keep going to the gym and having those negative experiences. I'm just to anxiety-ridden and depressed to not go to the gym but at the same time when it's making those symptoms worse... I don't know I just need some encouragement.","I'm 19, I weigh 235 lb I used to be 250 at the beginning of the year, but it's really hard to keep exercising.

He loved it, we were out there with head lights some nights. When he wasn't riding he was watching videos on how to get better. Then at the end of June he went down hard and fractured his arm. While he was in his cast he was itching to get riding again and when he finally got the chance to he was on his bike within an hour of being given the ok. A few hours later he went down hard again. He escaped with a bruise, nothing broken. Now he won't ride and if he does, he'll spend five minutes getting his gear on, get on and ride for 30 seconds and then put it away. He told me in secret he is scared, he doesn't want to get hurt. We aren't pushing him but he is seriously down.

"Despite that I've been on medication since last October, I still can't resume the way how I used to live.

I'm now taking steps to rebuild my life despite the fact that I'm also affected by him though we've been in two different countries since November last year.

"I have been working since I was 14 (picking fruit on farms during the summer for 2 years) and on my own since 19 (I'm 32). I really hate relying on people and as this point I'm forced to because all my savings are gone. I come from a poorer family and they don't have money to share. I was so excited for the move because I honestly thought I had a great resume, and an awesome portfolio (for landscape design). I have reached out to the design companies in my area and never recieved a courtesy email back. I do have a lot of anxiety so cold calling, and calling back multiple times (especially when they have ignored me once) makes it super hard. I don't have a lot of people I can talk to because I don't want to bug my friends and family anymore. I'm always complaining about the same things... I am trying to find a therapist, but we only have coverage for maybe 2 or 3 visits. I'm trying to find someone who will work on a sliding scale because 2 visits isn't enough and I want to stick with the same person if I like them. Anyway. Not sure if this is in the right place.... Just needed to vent. TL DR: followed partner to city for his job... Quit mine...  can't find one. Now I'm jobless and sad.","I have been working since I was 14 (picking fruit on farms during the summer for 2 years) and on my own since 19 (I'm 32).

"So short story is I am a 40yo married man who has fallen in love with Jade (name changed) who is a 20yo deaf Chinese girl who works as a sex worker.Yes I know...Pre covid I would pay Jade for sex  once a week, and we would chat during the week on wechat using its translation function. I have tried to learn Chinese sign language but have found it really hard.Sometimes we would go for dinner or drinks which was off the clock. Jade knows that I am married and that I will never leave my with. Jade and I have talked about our relationship and agreed we are friends. I think about her every day and sometimes wish I could be with her, but we only get one life to live.For most of this year we have not met but still chat regularly. I hope I can see her again soon.There are plenty of places I can go for criticism and Understand that, but if there is anyone who has a few words of encouragement it would be appreciated.If this post is met with silence, thats ok.","So short story is I am a 40yo married man who has fallen in love with Jade (name changed) who is a 20yo deaf Chinese girl who works as a sex worker.Yes I know...Pre covid I would pay Jade for sex  once a week, and we would chat during the week on wechat using its translation function.

For 4 years I have been dating a high functioning autistic woman. (30) She lived with her parents for the entire duration. Recently her father quit his job because he couldnt take a vacation the days he wanted to.Within 3 days of hearing this story I was informed they would be moving across the state and that she would be going with them. Note at this time we had plans for marriage and had a great relationship.Today she ended our relationship. Her reasons where not her own they were the exact parrotings of her parents far right wing conservatives note that I am not white or conservative. We never let this affect anything or even talk about it. 3 months ago I had open heart surgery at 29. I now noticed since then things have gone downhill.Long story short she made me feel used worthless and broken. That I dont have my life together and cannot be a Provider. But I know these are not her words. Unfortunately nothing I say will bring her back. I just need some assurance Im not those things she said. Please.,For 4 years I have been dating a high functioning autistic woman. (30) She lived with her parents for the entire duration.

"Hi.  I finished my original degree 17 years ago and have worked in IT since then but the past year had really made me fall out of \~\~love\~\~ like with that.  I've wanted a masters for a long time with the idea that eventually I'd pursue a new career as a public policy analyst so I've gone back to undergraduate courses in economics and math with the idea if I do well I'll pursue a masters in economics but if not maybe public policy or political science or just go back to work.  Of note I'm married with a 6 moth old daughter.Well...I showed up to my first calculus test (I originally passed it with an 89.6 in 2002 but am retaking it to prepare for calculus II) and the teacher told us we couldn't use our calculators and to put them away. We all panic.  I didn't even finish the test.  Well, I just got back my grade and it's a 37/100 and I'm panicking thinking this was all a mistake quitting my career to go back to school just to try and find a career I was actually passionate about.  I'm enjoying learning but failing that bad has me in panic mode.  I already struggle with depression and I'm hoping to benefit from talking with someone about it.  I don't feel like I can talk to my wife about it. :(","Hi.

"I've been away from school for a few years dealing with personal things and now I'm finally deciding to go back. I have a lot of doubts and insecurities about how much money I'm spending on a degree that might not actually do me any good, especially since I took a few years off from getting it. But this is not a decision I'm making lightly, and it's one I've spent many many nights thinking about. It seems every time I bring up these fears with people they advise me to keep waiting until I'm sure, or to think about getting a different degree. They love me and are trying to support me, but I think they miss the point... and I've only felt worse since I began making these fears known. To clarify I'm going back for a science BA in geology, a passion of mine. Any sort of words of positivity or encouragement would go a long way for me. I try my best to be an optimist, but lately I feel very pessimistic about this very big deal in my life that I was originally looking so forward to.

Im hoping to process with the USMC right away so I can ship out, and when I come home were getting married. Weve been through a lot over the last year and change and while a lot of the BS in my life has come because of my involvement with him (parent drama, distraction from school resulting in failing a couple classes)- Id much rather have him in my life than live the sheltered and abusive lifestyle I had before him. Please encourage me about the National Guard discharge process! Or any advice on money, moving out etc. Im 22. Female. I did four years of college.

"Ima a 20 yrs female moving out soon with my bf of 5years to rent a place. I feel like I'm being held back mentally because of my mom. Everyday is different with her mood (she isn't diagnosed with anything that I know of) for example: if I hang out most of the day with my bf, her mood is a flip of a coin once I arrive. If I hang out too often then she flips out on me. I'm afraid of moving out because I don't know the outcome of what will happen which ik won't be good.

"So now Im at home, its been a month now and Ive been looking for a job since the 2nd of January since me and my parents agreed it would be okay to wait until after Christmas to get things sorted out. The advice they gave me before I left was dont think getting a job will be easy and I understood that, but when its been just over a week since I applied for my first job all Ive heard from my dad is do have a job yet but its not an encouraging way or just asking a question, he belittles me, bullies me, doesnt give me a fucking break, the first thing he does when he gets home is come to my bedroom and cause hassle for no reason, my mums told him constantly to back off but he doesnt, my mums been sick recently so when its just him he really likes to go into me, for example I was filling out a CV/rsum to apply for a job and he came in to my room and said turn that off you dickhead, listen here your not a fucking man what you were doing you were a man but what your doing now your not and you never will be, listen if you dont have a job by the end of January Ill have you, Ill smash your fucking face in, and I think Ive gone on to much so Ill just wind it back a bit, so hes pissed off because his friends have pretty good jobs and something to be proud of, him not so much, now out all hes done he had nothing to be proud of except me, all he had was me and my achievement of at least trying to gain a career so early, it was my choice but he feels that now that thing hes proud of has gone now that hes back to himself with nothing to show even if worse with a failed son who tried to be in the military, he takes it on me, cause to him if I stayed he wouldnt have this, to him once I said I wanted that career he saw no other one for me, and when I did and left he resented me and has resented me since I got back.","So now Im at home, its been a month now and Ive been looking for a job since the 2nd of January since me and my parents agreed it would be okay to wait until after Christmas to get things sorted out.

"We lose out on something which was very dear to us, when our identity is lost, hope also takes a backseat and we are left hanging just to be tossed around by the unprecedented consequences, like in this Covid. This begs some fundamental questions, where does your identity lie? What things are you putting your hope on? Weve seen and understood clearly nothing is permanent. This diminishing hope is very insecure and can cover our mind with anxiousness and fear. Its not a good place to be in when everything you trust in is fading away. Did you identify yourself with your job, were you putting trust in your friends all this time, did you make plans to save up on money for future?And what happens when these things are affected. Scary, right?Yes, a similar incident is what Im still going through. Ive been waiting since 3 years to join as a pilot in an airline.

"I've been reading some things on Reddit that have re-activated my fears of never getting a partner. It's like a massive weightful dread and sadness that I don't know what to do with. I looked up and found this subreddit because I feel like a withered plant who never got any masculine encouragement to try different risky things and take action despite fears, including talking to girls. And I feel starved for female attention as well, which creates a self-perpetuating cycle. I would love if I had men and women in my life who supported me with approaching people socially, either for romantic purposes or just trying crazy things. But most of the people around me seem anxious and not to know how to provide that sounding board. They wouldn't tell me to jump off a waterfall if it was actually safe and I was just scared.Another thing I could use encouragement on is a large project of mine, which I don't know how to start, because much of it requires social buy-in from others to get going. But also, in order for it to get going, it needs social buy-in. So I probably need to wait until I have more resources, but then there's this voice in my head saying ""why wait?"". So it's frustrating.","I've been reading some things on Reddit that have re-activated my fears of never getting a partner.

When I got into school, I jumped into choir as soon as it was available to me. 6th grade. And I loved it so much. When I got to 7th grade, we moved to a new school and the choir teacher there was amazing. She encouraged me, and gave me more and more responsibility for my section and countless solos before adding me to her elite choir that went around and performed live at different places in our city. Even within that choir, she gave me solos and encouraged me. I felt confident and I loved to perform, even just blended into the choir. I loved it. I moved again in 9th grade. This choir teacher was awful. She did nothing but tear me down, hide me in the choir and ask me to be quiet.","I am still in a bad predicament, though I know things can't stay here forever.

"First, a bit of context. I'm 15 (close to 16) and have mild autism. In my normal non-school life, I play games like Guitar Hero, Tetris, and StepMania (I'm good at them), watch YouTube videos, look at Tumblr, browse Reddit every once in a while, and ignore my Twitter notifications.The reason why I even use Tumblr is because of Pokemon (specifically Vaporeon, he's my favorite). I found an ask blog from a google image search and now I look at posts from blogs that I follow. But nothing holds me over for more than a few seconds without making me think, ""Why aren't I doing this? I could be a part of this!

"Today I was let let go / let down by not only the person I was romantically involved with for 9 years, but also fired by that very same person. I can't say i didn't see it coming, but between sobs I'm trying to keep my head up and move forward. So far, I have a list of things I need to do in order to get myself back on track! I'm looking for some pick me up so when I get down I have something to reference to keep me moving. The list is: * Cancel all my monthly subscriptions (google music, audible, 8fit and so on) Except netflix and hulu, so I at lease have some happy things to watch*Downgrade cable/tv/internet to internet only - It's cheaper to hold on to my netflix hulu combo with internet service than it is to have the whole package*Sell unnecessary things like the Harley I own that I got so he and I could ride together, past that I have no interest. A gold necklace I own that I bought as an impulse that I never wear. A saddle that I have, that doesn't fit my horse.","Today I was let let go / let down by not only the person I was romantically involved with for 9 years, but also fired by that very same person.

"im 19, ive been arrested twice for marijuana. once when I was 17 and then again when I was 18, it was over a year ago and im still going to court for it. yesterday I sat in the court room for almost 5 hours just for them to give me another court date. I broke down and started ugly crying in front of the prosecutor. it was so frustrating. I went to rehab in april. I was bad off on xanax and I overdosed. but it was on purpose. my dad kicked me out, so I moved in with my great aunt. shes nice. but I dont feel like I can talk to her. I got a new job, but I had to quit because the dish guy was harassing me. it got to the point where I was terrified to go into work and all they told me was to just leave him alone. so I quit. every time something good happens 10 bad things happen. I wrecked my car and I have a rental car now, but whatever money the insurance gives me my dad is just gonna use to pay off the car that I wrecked. so getting a new car is on me and I have no money. no job. im getting really fucking tired of this shit. all my friends do drugs so I pretty much lost all of them when I got out of rehab. ive stayed clean for the most part, ive only drank and smoked weed a handful of times. i has a job interview today but I couldnt go because I didnt have enough gas in my car. i just want a fucking break.","im 19, ive been arrested twice for marijuana. once when I was 17 and then again when I was 18, it was over a year ago and im still going to court for it. yesterday I sat in the court room for almost 5 hours just for them to give me another court date.

"Acting positive. Being positive about my job even though it's gotten dire.I'm just angry, sad and lost. I don't have any friends here.

I hate when I get like this because I'm very draining when I'm this symptomatic. Some of them have stopped picking up the phone, which is understandable. I guess I'm just asking for any encouragement on this situation. I don't even know how to take my first step forward. I have been crying almost all of my waking hours since about 10pm last night.

"I just got back from a trip and I am miserable. I currently live in a town I dont like while waiting to go back to Uni. Its been a rough time and Im having a bad day. Feeling unproductive, sad, and wishing I was in school and not in this slow, boring town. I spend 9 hours a day on my phone. I am always in bed, watching boring tv shows. None of the non credit classes I wanted to take work for my schedule. I am in a transition with my job so my pay is less than it used to be. It sucks.Its also my mothers birthday and I dont want to be a party pooper at her B-Day dinner! So I could use some encouragement, toasting, and maybe even suggestions of stuff to do.","I just got back from a trip and I am miserable.

"Just need a little encouragement. A man threatened suicide when I told him I no longer wanted to date. I helped him get help and when I thought the situation deescalated, I left. He since has sent numerous texts and emails. Finally, he sent a 4-page letter to my house claiming that I caused all of the anxiety, depression, and desire to end it all. I filed a PFA (protection from abuse) against him. He is an abuser and its going to take a lot to be in the same room as him tomorrow - and to listen to him make up his version of reality, and to fight the protection I am seeking.I am hoping against hope that the judge believes me and is willing to grant this order to give me some peace of mind.","Just need a little encouragement.

"So. Im a near-first-time cosplayer, and Im not very confident in myself. For reference, Im in middle school (Almost done!), so confidence doesnt necessarily come easily. My sister and her entire friend group cosplay a bunch and sometimes, when I look at their cosplays, I think theyre way better than mine ever could be, even though I know theyre older and more experienced. Im actually in my Tanjiro cosplay right now, and I want to post it to /r/cosplay, but Im really scared someone will diss me because its not good or I dont have contacts or something. This is kind of a stupid problem and pretty light compared to some of the other, heavier stuff on this subreddit.","So. Im a near-first-time cosplayer, and Im not very confident in myself.

I get so nervous that my mouth becomes dry, palms sweat, feet shake and I just cant get my mind straight. I am so mad because of that. I know that I have enough skill to pass the test but this nervousness gets the best of me. Please, encourage.","Hey there everyone!

"So, I've been best friends for a year and a half with a girl(I am a guy) and I'm talking the kind of friendship that we can tell each other anything and everything and know that the other isn't going to judge and is just there to listen and give advice.In November I finally told her that I had feelings for her after debating in my head for 4 months. She said she also had feelings for me and we were proud of each other for finally letting it out. However, ever since then it feels like there is a rift in the friendship that I had zero intention of creating, you see, I never fully wanted to get into a relationship as she had just started her freshman year of college and I am in my Junior year of highschool(we're only a year apart in age) so we were both stressed with school. I was just tired of holding it in and wanted to get it off my chest.As it stands now, we still talk but it's not the same. It's not the deep talks we used to have, she won't talk to me about anything that's bothering her, and there is something, she's said so multiple times, I just can't get her to open up anymore. I don't know what I did or how to fix it and it's driving me crazy and it's making me feel like giving up on everything. She's the kind of friend that I really don't want to lose and would rather keep as a best friend than ruin that by getting into a relationship. If anyone has any advice at all, it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.","So, I've been best friends for a year and a half with a girl(I am a guy) and I'm talking the kind of friendship that we can tell each other anything and everything and know that the other isn't going to judge and is just there to listen and give advice.In November I finally told her that I had feelings for her after debating in my head for 4 months.

"Hey guys. So Ive been struggling a lot with self-esteem when it comes to my looks. Ive had the same haircut since like 4th grade  (10th grade now) and get teased about it. About a month ago I tried something new, only to be made fun of for that. I ended up reverting back to my old hairstyle. Today i got a haircut (just shortened my hair, didnt change the style) and, once again I was made fun of, even by an adult coworker. I have acne pretty bad, and regardless of what I try its just inexorable. My ears stick out super far, and the young kids I work with say I look like an elf. I have major bags under my eyes due to a type of insomnia, and my face is unsymmetrical when I examine it.At this point its just a struggle to deal with all these things. Im fairly popular but still face social anxiety, especially when talking to girls, due to my low opinion of my looks. I could really use some encouragement. Any and all is welcome.

Im fairly popular but still face social anxiety, especially when talking to girls, due to my low opinion of my looks. I could really use some encouragement. Any and all is welcome. Thanks guys :)"

"I feel like such a jerk posting this, because I feel like I should feel grateful for having such supportive family and friends. Anyone else feeling burnt out by all the check in phone calls, Skypes, Zooms, and texts? I am a fairly strong introvert by nature. I require downtime to charge my batteries. I am also a nurse, and I'm working 9-10 hours a day (not much for a nurse I know when I see the 12-14 hour/day shifts my colleagues are working.)By day, I take care of  sick, nervous, scared, concerned people and their families. The place where I work restricted visitors, so now in addition to caring for the patient, I'm also on the phone with their family updating on conditions and also providing emotional support. It's draining and I used to rely on the gym, my meditation center, and puttering around the grocery store as ways to decompress. I can't do that right now.By evening it's the litany of phone calls with family and friends. I love that they care about me so much, but it's getting to the point where I feel anxiety by hearing my text chirp or hearing the phone ring because my cup is empty and I'm not getting a chance to refill it. I currently have a friend upset with me because she has wanted to catch up and I've put her off for two days because I'm so damn tired. My dishes and laundry are piling up because I feel like I work all day and then chat on the phone all night. I'm exhausted and just need a break.

"I [19F] just broke up with my boyfriend [22M] I am heartbroken and lost. I met him a couple months ago and I fell so hard and so fast for him. Now I dont have anything. I knew he was the one, I knew he would be the one who I would marry and be there till the end. I have messed up so bad and theres nothing I can do. I feel so hopeless.. I lost my soulmate, he was and still is my everything. I dont wanna live my life without him. I cant keep dealing with heartbreak. This has happened too many times. I cant do it. When Im heartbroken I get really bad depression. Im taking medicine for it but it still hurts. For once can I be treated right.. do I not deserve anything good in my life? Am I not deserving of love? Is there something wrong with me? Am I unloving.. I need encouragement that its gonna be okay because I have no one else..

"Some background: I work inventory for a website that sells trading cards, and I've been mildly crushing on a coworker for awhile now. She's nice, funny, quiet, shy, cute, and from the little bit we've interacted she seems like an interesting person. We haven't interacted much outside of passing conversation because I'm also a pretty quiet and shy person, so the few times I've had the chance I've never been able to think of a way to interact with her without it seeming very forced or making it awkward for one or both of us. The crush level has gone up recently because she got me a cheesecake platter for my birthday. Not an unusual thing as she's always bringing in cookies for everyone but it made my day all the same. I've got the chance to return the favor, but it's not under quite the best of circumstances; She's got a surgery scheduled for this week, and while it's not major she's said she's still really scared (Can't blame her). Add in her having a bout of the flu and she's been in a pretty bad place the last few weeks.I decided to get her something to cheer her up and settled on making her cannoli (I saw from a FB post of hers that she liked it) and spent the last few days carefully finding out her favorite flavors and any food allergies she may have without directly asking her.","Some background: I work inventory for a website that sells trading cards, and I've been mildly crushing on a coworker for awhile now.

It's a selfless act that takes a lot more courage and pains than you realise.,Because it takes a lot of courage to actually admit that you can't give them the love and allow them to find someone else who can love them like you should.

"TL:DR at bottomFor 16 years Ive been alive and most of it I loved. Only when I left my house that is, I have a single mother parent who emotional abuses me calling it parenting. I tell her I love you so I can get alone time (I dont actually mean it) if I dont say anything to her she goes off ranting through out the house and calls relatives to give them false stories, I thinks, and so forth thinking her assumptions are correct. Its gotten to the point that the only things keeping me sane at this point are my two little brothers knowing if she does kill me (shes held knifes and hammers to my head and neck) my little brothers will have nowhere secure to go to. Im starting to crack under the pressure I just need people to talk to.TL:DR Im a victim of emotional abuse under the disguise of parenting and the only thing keeping me together is my brothers.

"I failed my driver's test today. It is completely eating away at me, I feel so ashamed. I failed because I couldn't parallel park. I tried to practice beforehand but I didn't have a whole lot of time, it was all so rushed. I feel awful. I tried so hard and I feel like everyone is disappointed. When I mentioned it to people before hand I got ""it's super easy, you'll do great"" and then I failed and now I feel terrible. It seriously is making me sick rn. Everyone's response was just sorta ""oh that sucks"" The worst part about it is, I have made everything so much harder for my parents. They needed me to be an extra driver. And we're really tight right now but they paid the 50 bucks even though we were gonna have trouble affording it and I wasted it. I completely let them down and I feel sick to my stomach about it. They tried to hide it but I could tell that they were disappointed. I feel terrible. I've been beating myself up all day about it. I feel like an absolute failure.

"Hi reddit, I'm in serious need of some encouragement words or some advice. Anything will do really. I'm not very good at this but let's give it a try.I'm 24, recently had to quit my job in order to finish my thesis and being able to get my fucking college degree. My Job was very stressful but it was my only source of income, I think I made the right decision by quitting but I'm in a tough spot right now.As you can imagine, working on a thesis is no easy feat and as of this moment I feel incredibly anxious, depressed and overwhelmed. I'm short of time and even shorter on motivation and willingness to live. I have no other income than my savings and I'm living with my parents. I also have to spend ALL the fucking day alone, working on my thesis and taking care of myself.I just don't know what to do anymore and it is only making me more anxious and overwhelmed. If maybe some of you could give me some advice or encouraging words, that would be great!Thank you so much for reading.","Hi reddit, I'm in serious need of some encouragement words or some advice.

Hes staying with his Mom house in my hometown, so were living apart. We probably need to move back to my hometown after a year living hours away since our support system is there and since thats where my husbands team of doctors is based.

I had to replace my tires recently. Work hasnt paid me back for my travel expenses. Now Im job hunting again and looking for new places to live. Im pretty broke, I cant visit my husband because the drive is so far and challenging and I only have less than 48 hours to make the trip. Im dealing with the loss of my mom, and how Im so unavailable because of my job, but I cant take a break from it because I wont get paid for it. Plus Im just feeling so shitty and unhappy with my body and Im just struggling so much. I know Ill be ok, but like...its just been bad day after bad day. Im a very positive person and have been handling this well, but Im having a spiral moment. Advice, encouragement and positivity are welcome.

"So short story is I am a 40yo married man who has fallen in love with Jade (name changed) who is a 20yo deaf Chinese girl who works as a sex worker.Yes I know...Pre covid I would pay Jade for sex  once a week, and we would chat during the week on wechat using its translation function. I have tried to learn Chinese sign language but have found it really hard.Sometimes we would go for dinner or drinks which was off the clock. Jade knows that I am married and that I will never leave my with. Jade and I have talked about our relationship and agreed we are friends. I think about her every day and sometimes wish I could be with her, but we only get one life to live.For most of this year we have not met but still chat regularly. I hope I can see her again soon.There are plenty of places I can go for criticism and Understand that, but if there is anyone who has a few words of encouragement it would be appreciated.If this post is met with silence, thats ok.","So short story is I am a 40yo married man who has fallen in love with Jade (name changed) who is a 20yo deaf Chinese girl who works as a sex worker.Yes I know...Pre covid I would pay Jade for sex  once a week, and we would chat during the week on wechat using its translation function.

"I checked the results of my recent assessment. Some was good and some was bad. It made me feel bad. I mean I dont know what I am doing right now, everything is in progress but I feel anxious and exhausted. Try to be happy at the beginning of every single day, however, it is always failed.

"I fear for my own future especially career wise. I do want to have a career in something that I love. Something that even on the worst of Monday's and even though it's very hard work I'll just love doing it. Unfortunately, I don't think I'll ever have that. I was born in Toronto Ontario Canada and I'm Autistic and as a child I was misdiagnosed and wasn't given the treatments and therapy I needed. I was put into a special class but it was for kids with ADHD which was what I was misdiagnosed with which I didn't have. Well, I never did well in school because I didn't get the help I needed. To make a long story short I just wasn't making my milestones or coming anywhere close to them so my parents pulled me out of school and homeschooled me. Now, when my parents homeschooled me there wasn't much information about it and not a whole lot of people did it, it just wasn't as common as it is now.","I fear for my own future especially career wise.

"Until the weekend before my ship date. Memorial weekend. We panicked and chose a medical abortion. We thought I could bleed out, then turn around and Ship. Well, the military is actually putting me through the wringer for not making my ship date. I told them I had a medical issue, and now they want to see the medical file which states a doc gave me methotrexate on 5/29. Now, if I hand this file over theyre submitting it to something called MEPS and it will disqualify me for any branch for at least six months, and due to it being an abortion I may be fully disqualified and need a psych eval. I cant tell my family any of this. They think I didnt ship due to a stomach ache. Theyre livid with me. Yelling at me daily. I know theyre extremely upset.

I am a struggling makeup student for 3 years and I finally got my first paid job for working on set for a short film. I was extremely anxious over it and stayed in a hotel for 4 days just to get some work experience which I never thought I could do this early on in my course. I did it and smashed it and I wasnt tagged in the promo post by the director who is also a student btw when he tagged everyone else. My parents werent too fussed either. I thought this was gonna be this massive achievement but now I feel like maybe I shouldnt feel so proud of myself as I am.,I am a struggling makeup student for 3 years and I finally got my first paid job for working on set for a short film.

A boy I was talking to just starting hanging out with his ex again and I found out. Hes a liar but I was really into him and my feelings are really hurt. Im starting to think Ill never be good enough for anybody. Im aware that I shouldnt worry about dumb boys but I cant help but to feel shitty. I should love myself to let him go but I still miss him and wish hed just come back and say the right things. Any advice on how to get over a mini relationship? I feel like I did all the right things and still failed. :/,A boy I was talking to just starting hanging out with his ex again and I found out.

"I'm feeling really low. A few months ago on I was promoted to my first management position. I was so excited to be In leadership and I really thought I could make a difference in someone's career. About 2 months ago I got my team, all new hires, and almost all straight out of  college with little or no job experience. They are so rough. After rigorous training almost all of them are rough, to be expected of course.What I wasnt expecting is to have 4 HR issues right of the bat and them escalating me to leadership above me. I have 3 that are are written warnings for attendance, 1 more and will be termed. 1 went to my leadership and asked if I was right. Unfortently I so know this may happen as people might be unhappy, especially if they are having performance issues. All day my leaders tell me that i have such a bad team and they feel so bad for me, that I'm doing great handling it and it's really breaking me in. I work in a corporate environment so it's very tricky to fire someone. This can be hard bc I'm in need to make an example of so.eone but instead people have figured out how to work the system. I go home and I feel so low. I guess its bc I really wanted to be great to my team but I feel like the group I have is horrible. They always have an issue, whether personal, or just unhappy with the job. They come in with a negative attitude and it sucks the life out of me to be positive for them and the rest of my team. The hard part is the need to treat them as though I dont hate them and still provide great management and fairness. I'm just kind of complaining but I'm in some real need of any encouragement right now. This job is not what I wanted it to be and I'm becoming really unhappy due to it.","I'm feeling really low.

"I transferred to a new school this semester with a 3.7 GPA, but since transferring I've been struggling a lot. The workload and material aren't any more difficult than before, but I'm guessing the transition to a new school out of state and away from my family for the first time, in addition to being sick 5 times during the semester, has made it difficult. I have an A, Bs and a C in my other classes at the moment, but my current biology class is the only one I have an F in. I've never failed a class before and I'm trying my hardest to redeem myself and ace the last two exams, but my confidence is not there. I'm already a semester behind because of transferring, I don't want to have to retake a class, and I don't know if I can get into vet school if I do fail. I've been having a panic attack all day and I know it's extreme, but I can't stop thinking about giving up and just dropping everything. I ask for words of encouragement to help me stay motivated through this.","I transferred to a new school this semester with a 3.7 GPA, but since transferring I've been struggling a lot.

"Cooking, cleaning, planning meals, doing odd jobs for money. Ive lost everything it feels like but our room mate is covering us for now. I got us food stamps and medicaid and Im trying to get help, hence the diagnosis. Please don't harass me about being on snap, I don't want to be on it and they only give me 25$ a week. Have you ever tried to feed 2 adults on that amount? It's ramen and bread and my weight just stays the same. I lost weight on keto a few years ago. 50 lbs. It alleviated my pcos symptoms. I was so happy. But I can't afford it now. I keep trying. I know that I need to suck it up and suffer through. I know that I should eat eggs for every meal and canned tuna and lose the weight by sheer determination. I know that the pain in my hips and ankles is nothing and I should just walk through it. I know I should take a job and just grind it out every day. But when I think about the pain of that, I feel like giving up and dying. I just don't think that I can do it, or this anymore.

"Im 7 months postpartum and having some trouble getting over PPD. Lots of crying lately and being overly sensitive to little things that wouldnt typically bother me. I guess just feeling pretty insecure personally. Also not feeling like myself- I used to do a lot alone like go to the mall, the movies, out to eat. I used to be very tidy and organized. I used to read and crochet. I do almost nothing that I did before I became a mom and now its like everything is about my son and if its not then I feel like a bad mom. Anyways, I just reached out to a girlfriend of mine and asked if she wouldnt mind going out for dinner so I could start trying to get out of the house. Would love some encouragement that this is a good step in the right direction because my heart is actually beating fast from embarrassment.","Im 7 months postpartum and having some trouble getting over PPD.

"At the start of 2019, I was 190 pounds. This was the result of emotional eating, then starving myself years after I left a sexually and emotionally abusive relationship.One of my family members suggested her Paleo diet. All she eats is meat, and she lost over 20 pounds (good for her). If she eats anything else, though, she gets hella sick.I didn't want to give up my love of food, so when I met up with my girl friends from university, one of them said she was starting a calorie-limited diet and asked if I wanted to join her. You bet your sweet southern ass I did!We limited our calories to be around 1200 calories a day. A lot of days, I had little food, so I ate as much as I could to satisfy my stomach, even though it was 400-900 calories. Even now I still eat once or twice a day.Because I got a new phone, I can finally play Pokmon Go and have a reason to walk around town, so exercise is a thing!I don't have a weight scale, but I have two milestones I want to announce!1) Last semester, I bought a Steampunk dress off of Wish, followed by a casual, over the shoulder corset. Neither of them fit me, as I was much larger than I anticipated. As of two weeks ago, I was finally able to wear the dress out in public and wore it for D&D!2) This morning, I hesitated to try on the corset, fearing that I was still too large. Eventually, I gave in.","At the start of 2019, I was 190 pounds.

I understand parenting is a priority but with this current child we literally cannot get out of the house. It's just too hard. I use to ride/run up to 20 miles a week and my wife use to run 10ish and do yoga 4 times a week. Now she is lucky to do yoga twice a month and I might get 30 minutes each week to run or ride. I'm kinda depressed, anxious about getting fat and catch myself slipping on my healthy foods. Wife feels the same. Im honestly just thinking about accepting my fate, buying larger clothes and just letting go. I dont want it but that's what seems to be happening.","I recently got married, then my wife and I decided to foster, then we moved. All within a year and a half.

I get so nervous that my mouth becomes dry, palms sweat, feet shake and I just cant get my mind straight. I am so mad because of that. I know that I have enough skill to pass the test but this nervousness gets the best of me. Please, encourage.Edit: thanks for kind words, everyone! I passed!

"I've been unemployed since January, basically fired from a great job I had for a few months. I've applied to jobs online and went to a temp agency but nothing has resulted in work. i don't have health insurance and my savings are being depleted. I have kept my employment hush hush, but I've heard that talking to people in your network can help you land a job. I've created a list of 6 ppl I can reach out to to talk about finding employment and support in my future endeavors (going to grad school).

I'm thinking about reaching out to everyone on the list in a blaze of motivation. Can I get some encouragement, a little pep talk?","I've been unemployed since January, basically fired from a great job I had for a few months. I've applied to jobs online and went to a temp agency but nothing has resulted in work. i don't have health insurance and my savings are being depleted. I have kept my employment hush hush, but I've heard that talking to people in your network can help you land a job. I've created a list of 6 ppl I can reach out to to talk about finding employment and support in my future endeavors (going to grad school).

"Hello, im not sure if i will continue to share my encouraging thought because people have been having problems because i use my faith to try to help people i was asked to only post everyother day because apperently im offending people, i dont understand why this offends anyone, if you dont want to read it then dont. But if you like these words of encouragement please respond!!! Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his Lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.
John 15:15 KJV
Dogs love is unconditional, always there for you, always glad to see you, ready to forgive you, love going places with you, will protect you from danger, and on and on. We would be fortunate to have a human friend who is faithful as a canine friend. Actually, we do have such a friend and such more than a four legged friend. That friend is Jesus and He understands everything we go through in life. Jesus can sympathize with our weaknesses. Human friends may disappoint us, but Jesus never will. He is a friend that ""sticks closer than a brother "" (Proverbs 18:24). Have a blessed weekend.  :)","Hello, im not sure if i will continue to share my encouraging thought because people have been having problems because i use my faith to try to help people i was asked to only post everyother day because apperently im offending people, i dont understand why this offends anyone, if you dont want to read it then dont.

"I've taken on a 3-year university course that is said to be really tough, but it's something I'm truly interested in. The thing about this university is that there is no project work, no presentation or participation points to help my grade- EVERYTHING is based on the results of a year-end exam. Last year, I failed ALL my modules and had to resit them, which makes me one year behind. This year, I managed to clear two of my toughest modules, but I failed the other two, which means that I now will take 5 years to graduate.My parents and friends are telling me not to beat myself up over it, but I can't help but feel so, so disappointed that I did not pass everything. I had such expectations for myself too.I guess I really feel insecure about graduating a lot later than everyone else I know. I feel really depressed that I can't do well in something that I like.","I've taken on a 3-year university course that is said to be really tough, but it's something I'm truly interested in.

But I know logically silence is an answer, but how can someone say they love you then be so mean and just drop you from their life, that is not love.I would give anything I have to be held right now, just to be held, to feel wanted, to feel loved, and maybe even be together and remember what being alive means. I am going to try to sleep for a while, I am so tired, maybe my heart will just stop while I sleep and the pain of waking up wont happen, I can only wish it would happen.

"Once again, my dad called me ""worthless,"" ""bitch,"" and ""asshole."" He's never used the word ""asshole"" on me before, so that's a new one. But anyway, I'm getting kind of sick and tired of him telling me this stuff. He always does it, and I'm starting to lose count of how many times he's verbally hurt me like this. You don't know how many times he's told me I won't have a future. After all, I'm out of the house in 4 years. He keeps reminding me of that like he doesn't want me anymore. I'm l just a Freshman, and I don't know what to do in life! It probably sounds ridiculous, I know. Literally, the only thing that is keeping me together at this point is the internet. People encourage others and make people laugh, even though you don't know them. Under all the craziness of school drama and life, I can still find some good online.   Anyway, I just need some tips on how to get my dad's words out of my head, or at least a link to a funny meme to cheer me up or something. I just need to stop overthinking all the stuff he yells at me for. I'm not good at explaining stuff, so can you just throw some comments at me?

"Ive been on a downward spiralMy fianc and I have moved in together at the start of 2020, which either highlighted or exposed some major dependency issues that she has. On top of that, her mental health has been beyond terrible for herwhich is likely a huge driving force for the dependencyand Ive gotten Caregivers Fatigue 3 or 4 times already. I desperately want to communicate this issue but she can already read it off of me (been together for a long time) which is making her mental health worse at times, and I think if we were to outright have that conversation it would cause her mental health to be even worse. She also gets upset that it seems like I view her as helpless and unable to function without me, and admittedly I do because shes so extremely needyI hate myself physically. Literally from my head to my toes: I cant find a good haircut and the barber that I helped out with that couldnt be consistent, then COVID hit and Im out a barber & reference point for my hair. Im in too low of a funk to consistently care about maintaining my beard which is as frustrating as daily care would be. Ive been gaining fat all of 2020 which not only do I want to lose weight but Im also a nutrition major so thats not a good look.","Ive been on a downward spiralMy fianc and I have moved in together at the start of 2020, which either highlighted or exposed some major dependency issues that she has.

I work in a corporate environment so it's very tricky to fire someone. This can be hard bc I'm in need to make an example of so.eone but instead people have figured out how to work the system. I go home and I feel so low. I guess its bc I really wanted to be great to my team but I feel like the group I have is horrible. They always have an issue, whether personal, or just unhappy with the job. They come in with a negative attitude and it sucks the life out of me to be positive for them and the rest of my team.

"Hi everyone,I'm feeling sad and could really use some encouragement. I've been on and off slightly sick for weeks, just body aches and fatigue that lasts only a day. Well, a few days ago I had that again, along with a minor fever, but this time the symptoms have lasted several days. It is totally bearable, but I am just feeling really emotional and tired of being sick. Today my fever is a little worse, and on top of that, I'm in grad school and my current class has us reading several readings a day plus long blog posts. I'm tired of having to read all day, write a long blog post, and being sick on top of that. I just want to lay in bed all day and relax, nap, and cry a little. I apologize if this post is too ""complain-y"" and I know there are much more important things in the world than me being tired of being sick. I am so thankful that I can do school from home and not have to go out for work, especially with the pandemic going on. I am also thankful that my symptoms are not as bad as many people right now, but I am also really scared that this might lowkey be covid and the symptoms will ramp up. I could just use some encouragement right now.","Hi everyone,I'm feeling sad and could really use some encouragement. I've been on and off slightly sick for weeks, just body aches and fatigue that lasts only a day. Well, a few days ago I had that again, along with a minor fever, but this time the symptoms have lasted several days.

"I just got back from a trip and I am miserable. I currently live in a town I dont like while waiting to go back to Uni. Its been a rough time and Im having a bad day. Feeling unproductive, sad, and wishing I was in school and not in this slow, boring town. I spend 9 hours a day on my phone. I am always in bed, watching boring tv shows. None of the non credit classes I wanted to take work for my schedule. I am in a transition with my job so my pay is less than it used to be. It sucks.Its also my mothers birthday and I dont want to be a party pooper at her B-Day dinner! So I could use some encouragement, toasting, and maybe even suggestions of stuff to do.","I just got back from a trip and I am miserable.

"Im a freshman in college and recently I moved about an hour away from home to attend school. The past few months have been absolutely dreadful, from moving in to an apartment to being late on rent every single month. My parents are separated so theyre always fighting over who should help me when money gets tight. Ive ran through about 3 jobs at my new location and cant seem to find the best job to keep me steady. I turn 20 literally on Friday and the fact that Im 20 with no stable income and barely getting by is killing my motivation and the way I want to handle things in life. I just feel like I have nothing going for me anymore. The only thing I can say Im motivated about is starting up my own kicking camp to teach high school football kickers the most important techniques and tips for training and in game situations. Besides that I cant find something to hold on to that would keep my head high and keep my motivation running. I just feel lost and empty and I wish I could ask for help but I know Ive already asked too many times. What are some tips you would have to keep a persons motivation running?","Im a freshman in college and recently I moved about an hour away from home to attend school.

"Why nursing?:As I mentioned before my passion and my driven mood is in the medical field. One of the most remunerating parts of a role in nursing is the capacity to associate with our patients on such a close level. While we frequently meet under exceptionally troublesome conditionsbeing available as individuals face genuine wellbeing difficulties or wounds, seeing the snapshot of birth or the finish of lifewe become more acquainted with our patients rapidly and have the chance to assume a significant function in their lives. I turned into an attendant so I could affect the lives of others and have a role that felt important.Why not dental, pharmacy, or any other career?I have looked into each of these careers and more but my whole academic career was based around being a medical school student. Ranging from classes to volunteer hours. Often times when looking at other careers, I found most needed stellar GPAs and volunteer hours in the respective field. Which as Im a senior who graduating in the fall, is just not possible to  do to jump start my possibility to meet at least what the average student does. I even looked at special masters programs and even non-master programs to help boost my gpa to somewhat offset myself but most masters programs I looked into required a 3.0, for me to take specialized test such as the MCAT, GRE, DAT, or more.","Why nursing?:As I mentioned before my passion and my driven mood is in the medical field.

"So, I really want to start up taking acting classes as I've always wanted to act, like really badly. There are plenty of teenage classes near where I live that I would love to try out but I don't have anybody to go with. Acting classes feel like a thing where people would definitely bring a friend along to help them feel less awkward and so i'm sure that everyone in the classes will have at least one person that they know.The problem I have is that none of my friends are remotely interested in acting and wouldn't join the classes with me. I'm trying to get the courage to go alone but right now i'm way too scared to sign up. Any advice on how to not be such a wimp or how to find a friend that likes acting? If it helps i'm 14F Originally posted on r/advice but not getting responses Any advice is appreciated, have a great day!","So, I really want to start up taking acting classes as I've always wanted to act, like really badly.

"Howdy yall! So life right now seems incredibly difficult. Earlier this year I packed up my entire life into boxes and moved to the Midwest in order to follow an opportunity. Its been great, but everything is incredibly overwhelming. Im triple majoring in Computer Science, Cyber Operations, and Network Security and Administration. Im participating in two college sports. I am actively doing AFROTC in pursuit of a commission into the US Air Force. I am lucky enough to have met a girl who makes my whole world better and a great group of friends. That being said I just feel overwhelmed by how much Im doing. I get really homesick sometimes, and some days I just feel really unmotivated. It would be really awesome if someone could just tell me Im not crazy and that Im setting up the future that I want and deserve (for reference Im 19).","Howdy yall!

"I'm 31. I was diagnosed this Tuesday with prediabetes and high cholesterol. They put me on statins. I wasn't surprised. I'm 360lbs and 5'5.I have PCOS and my hormones have always been awful. I don't have periods, never did even when I was smaller. I can probably grow a mustache and beard. The upkeep is frustrating. I have always felt worthless. I was getting gal bladder attacks regularly for 3 years but I thought I was faking it for sympathy. I spent several months trying to get the pain diagnosed. My job fired me for absences, even though I scheduled them and got written permission. Temp manufacturing work. 1 year and a half. Didn't matter. 1 week later I was hospitalized. Almost died. Several surgeries to remove my gallbladder and several stones. When I got home I should've done physical therapy. I was always active. I put on weight. 100 lbs. I tried to do call centers. Found out that years of emotional abuse had made it so I just sob when customers yell at me.","I'm 31. I was diagnosed this Tuesday with prediabetes and high cholesterol. They put me on statins.

"Hey guys. So Ive been struggling a lot with self-esteem when it comes to my looks. Ive had the same haircut since like 4th grade  (10th grade now) and get teased about it. About a month ago I tried something new, only to be made fun of for that. I ended up reverting back to my old hairstyle. Today i got a haircut (just shortened my hair, didnt change the style) and, once again I was made fun of, even by an adult coworker. I have acne pretty bad, and regardless of what I try its just inexorable. My ears stick out super far, and the young kids I work with say I look like an elf. I have major bags under my eyes due to a type of insomnia, and my face is unsymmetrical when I examine it.At this point its just a struggle to deal with all these things. Im fairly popular but still face social anxiety, especially when talking to girls, due to my low opinion of my looks. I could really use some encouragement. Any and all is welcome. Thanks guys :)","Hey guys. So Ive been struggling a lot with self-esteem when it comes to my looks. Ive had the same haircut since like 4th grade  (10th grade now) and get teased about it.

"I'm a 20 year old guy who struggles with bipolar depression. I attend college but honestly have no real clue what I wanna do with my life, I have a very strong interest in mathematics though and would love to help advance technology. Last semester I got straight As but sacrificed my social life for it, and now even when I try to make friends at school, nobody shares similar interests to myself or cares to pay any attention to me. Everyone else just cares about stuff I don't care about like drugs or video games, I want to get out and explore new things. I love action sports but I have lost interest recently due to both my depression and lack of friends to bike and skate with. I really need a girl in my life to help me, I have a more sensitive side that I'm showing now that needs to be vented. Ive only kissed or had a relationship with one girl ever and she cheated on me after two weeks. I am such a sincere and open-minded person and girls always turn me down, or claim to really like me a friend ( I'm fine with that) and later avoid me. Finally, I met an adorable girl recently who I connect with so well, but she only wanted to be friends, which I agreed to, yet now she always has a lame excuse to ignore me.

"So the title says it all. I grew up in an abusive household, but not too abusive where it was enough to call CPS. So I dont really have anywhere to go back to. Somehow, I made it through high school, but it was difficult. I was sexually abused as a child for years by kids my age and several adults, including my parents saw it happen or at least knew about it and did nothing about it. Ive also been physically abused by friends and by my parents to a mild extent. Im on the journey of healing and have been for about 3 years now but its hard. Back home was a bad place for me. Then senior year rolled around and long story short my life changed and I actually have people in my life who love and care for me. I even have a few adults that look after me for the first time ever. Until recently, I had to raise myself completely, and now I have a tad bit of help. The problem is that its difficult to get in touch with people from home because they straight up dont answer my calls as much as I wish they would. And the people that do are not the type of people Im comfortable sharing personal details with. I fell for a boy this summer for the first time and it was really difficult to navigate because of my history of abuse but he was probably one of the most amazing people Ive ever met. But then he decided to pretend like I didnt exist because it hurt too much for him to say goodbye.","So the title says it all.

"So...Today I was planning on giving myself a pizza birthday with anyone who wanted to join on my campus. I only have two friends. I got a check for $100 yesterday that I cashed and I have been looking forward to this all week. Even after my birthday that happened this past Wednesday. I had some bills to pay like hulu and neflix which I didn't mind. But i made sure that I was saving enough to I could buy the stuff. I got on the bus. Got some drinks for myself and I got two bracelets from hot topic too but what I didn't realize was that most of my billing stuff happened today. So I went from $60 to $8 cause I didn't know my netflix bill and hulu bill happened today. So after I bought drinks and two cool bracelets for myself, I didn't have enough money to buy my pizzas. I was at target and I had put two digornio's stuffed cheese pizzas in my cart and I was trying to check my bank finances cause I always get paranoid that money is going to disappear. But I had $40 after I bought my bracelets.","So...Today I was planning on giving myself a pizza birthday with anyone who wanted to join on my campus. I only have two friends.

"Hey there everyone! I am a Russian guy who desperately tries to get a driving license for himself but have failed miserably 3 times already. I am here for the 4th time trying to get into the right mindset to I finally accomplish what I want today but I am awfully nervous. The thing is that when I drive with an instructor from driving school where I went, I feel at ease and I relatively good at it but when it comes to passing the test and I have an officer riding shotgun who observes me driving, assessing me, I am get all messed up. I get so nervous that my mouth becomes dry, palms sweat, feet shake and I just cant get my mind straight. I am so mad because of that. I know that I have enough skill to pass the test but this nervousness gets the best of me. Please, encourage.Edit: thanks for kind words, everyone! I passed! I cant describe how helpful your kind words were. Thanks a lot! I am grateful to have Reddit installed on my phone, Jesus Christ. I can rest now.","Hey there everyone!

"I have a part-time retail job which admittedly I love, mostly because of an awesome manager. But it's not enough to live on, so I'm planning to get some electrician training. There's always a market for that, they're unionized, and I love working with my hands. So far, so good. I've located a technical college that:\- is less than half an hour from my house (\*super convenient\*)\- has a six-month certificate program (\*not so short that it feels incomplete, not so long that I get frustrated\*)\- offers job placement assistance after graduation (\*SCORE!\*)\- classes start at 7:45 AM (\*record scratch sound effect...\*)Oh dear. There's a reason I work the evening shift. I know this is a petty thing to get hung up on in the face of such an otherwise-perfect opportunity, but it's been a VERY long time since I've been required to get up early on a regular basis. And now I'm on medication with a side effect of insomnia. My current situation is unsustainable, and these early classes will allow me to stick with my usual evening shift; but I have a long history of being easily discouraged and can already feel myself backpedaling. I need someone to talk me out of talking myself out of this.","I have a part-time retail job which admittedly I love, mostly because of an awesome manager.

"Im 19, in college about to finish my freshman year. Im sitting in the kitchen of my parents house. I dont want to tell them how I feel because I dont want to be a burden. Ive told my friends, but I feel like a burden to them, even after they try to encourage me. My best friend for the best 11 years was put down yesterday. The girl Ive been talking to may or may not have just blocked my number for reasons I dont know. I dont feel like I belong anywhere. Im tired, I feel weak, Im scared, and I feel alone even though I know Im not. I dont know why I feel this way. I have to fight to find the motivation to get out of bed every morning.","Im 19, in college about to finish my freshman year. Im sitting in the kitchen of my parents house.

"I guess Ill explain my situation. For about 3 months now Ive been talking to this girl. After our first date she said she didnt feel anything for me and so I tried to move on. After about a week of not talking to her she texted me asking how my day was. Since that day she started talking to me non stop every day. She then started to get kind of flirty and lead me on. When I talked to her about it, she said she was confused because she didnt feel anything originally and now she thinks things are changing. I was excited and so I just kept doing what I was doing and things were going great. Things went bad on Friday the 27th. The subject of our relationship status got brought up again and she said she was conflicted and part of her wants to just remain friends and part of her wants something more. I asked her if we could talk about it in person but we had to end up FaceTiming. It turns out all that flirting and leading on was her intentionally doing that to see if she was interested. What I took as affection turned out to be experimentation and at this point she was trying to avoid telling me the truth. Ive been rejected before but this one was different.","I guess Ill explain my situation. For about 3 months now Ive been talking to this girl. After our first date she said she didnt feel anything for me and so I tried to move on. After about a week of not talking to her she texted me asking how my day was. Since that day she started talking to me non stop every day. She then started to get kind of flirty and lead me on. When I talked to her about it, she said she was confused because she didnt feel anything originally and now she thinks things are changing.

"Hey. 22 year old guy, living in a small town in West Texas. Moved here for my first job outside of college. The job is good, and I have a good group of people out here. But I'm hiding from a lot of people that I'm gay. My closest friends know. My family knows. But the people I'm with day in and day out don't know. So in some ways I'm still in closest there, but what's hurting me the most is those who I'm out to. My friends will just keep making ""fag"" jokes. My family will still keep asking why I haven't found a girl. When I'm going to grow out of ""that phase in college where I dated guys"". I'm tired of being different. I wish I could just love a woman, or be normal... Whatever. I just want someone to tell me I'll be okay. Thanks Internet. ","Hey. 22 year old guy, living in a small town in West Texas.

"There wasn't as many curriculum's then as there is now and the curriculum's weren't as advanced as the one's now. So, anyways when my parents pulled me out of school I was in the 5th grade but after testing me on a few things to see where I was, most of what I knew was a kindergarten level maybe grade one. So, it was very hard work but I did catch up, although unfortunately because my Autism (it's not my parents fault, they honestly tried and so did I) I wasn't able to do the work required of me to graduate. There were subjects I just couldn't grasp and understand at the time. So, I wasn't able to graduate high school. My Mom talked with me about my future (we were living in U.S.A in southern California at this time, we moved there when I was 16 years old) and she didn't blame me for not graduating. She knew I tried really hard and it wasn't my fault or hers or anyone else's that I didn't graduate. So, anyways her and I talked and she thought it would be a good idea for me to live on disability rather then get a job, so I applied. After 15 years of going to several doctors being diagnosed over and over again with Autism and 15 years of fighting to get on disability or any help for my Autism at all and being denied for any help and disability over and over again for 15 years I was done, I had enough.","There wasn't as many curriculum's then as there is now and the curriculum's weren't as advanced as the one's now.

"There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.
1 John 4:18 KJV
In Psalm 55:22 it says, ""Cast thy burden upon the Lord , and he shall sustain thee: he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved."" In Proverbs 22:10 it says, ""Cast out the scorner, and contention shall go out; yea, strife and reproach shall cease."" Apostle Paul said in Romans 13:12, ""The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light."" And Apostle Peter to us in 1 Peter 5:7 ""Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you."" As you have noticed it's all about casting. When we learn to love, insecurity and fear of getting hurt, physically and or emotionally shall be cast out. Cast out everything to the Lord and the fear shall be cast out. Have a blessed day.  :)","There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.

"Hello reddit strangers, I could use some encouragement this morning. I am fighting my demons and they are winning. I cant go to the hospital I would lose everything and truly have nothing to live for. Life without reason is no life, so if you say go to the hospital, I will put that in the just kill yourself category. I am in pain, such pain right now I am having trouble seeing that it will ever end.I met a girl before the crap happened, and we went out every week a few times each week for many months. There was a instant chemistry, it was like we had known each other for years. We laughed at the same jokes, we liked the same music, we were both sensual creatures with each other. We had such a great time together, laughing, making out, and just holding each other.We talked about the future, what we wanted to do together, places to visit, things to do, how our live would be together. We talked about getting a house together and cooking dinner and watching movies and playing with her daughter, we created a life that we both wanted.","Hello reddit strangers, I could use some encouragement this morning.

"Ive been on a downward spiralMy fianc and I have moved in together at the start of 2020, which either highlighted or exposed some major dependency issues that she has. On top of that, her mental health has been beyond terrible for herwhich is likely a huge driving force for the dependencyand Ive gotten Caregivers Fatigue 3 or 4 times already. I desperately want to communicate this issue but she can already read it off of me (been together for a long time) which is making her mental health worse at times, and I think if we were to outright have that conversation it would cause her mental health to be even worse. She also gets upset that it seems like I view her as helpless and unable to function without me, and admittedly I do because shes so extremely needyI hate myself physically. Literally from my head to my toes: I cant find a good haircut and the barber that I helped out with that couldnt be consistent, then COVID hit and Im out a barber &amp; reference point for my hair. Im in too low of a funk to consistently care about maintaining my beard which is as frustrating as daily care would be. Ive been gaining fat all of 2020 which not only do I want to lose weight but Im also a nutrition major so thats not a good look.","Ive been on a downward spiralMy fianc and I have moved in together at the start of 2020, which either highlighted or exposed some major dependency issues that she has.

"I'm 31. I was diagnosed this Tuesday with prediabetes and high cholesterol. They put me on statins. I wasn't surprised. I'm 360lbs and 5'5.I have PCOS and my hormones have always been awful. I don't have periods, never did even when I was smaller. I can probably grow a mustache and beard. The upkeep is frustrating. I have always felt worthless. I was getting gal bladder attacks regularly for 3 years but I thought I was faking it for sympathy. I spent several months trying to get the pain diagnosed. My job fired me for absences, even though I scheduled them and got written permission. Temp manufacturing work. 1 year and a half. Didn't matter. 1 week later I was hospitalized. Almost died. Several surgeries to remove my gallbladder and several stones. When I got home I should've done physical therapy. I was always active. I put on weight. 100 lbs. I tried to do call centers. Found out that years of emotional abuse had made it so I just sob when customers yell at me.","I'm 31. I was diagnosed this Tuesday with prediabetes and high cholesterol. They put me on statins.

I wrecked my car and I have a rental car now, but whatever money the insurance gives me my dad is just gonna use to pay off the car that I wrecked. so getting a new car is on me and I have no money. no job. im getting really fucking tired of this shit. all my friends do drugs so I pretty much lost all of them when I got out of rehab. ive stayed clean for the most part, ive only drank and smoked weed a handful of times. i has a job interview today but I couldnt go because I didnt have enough gas in my car. i just want a fucking break.","im 19, ive been arrested twice for marijuana. once when I was 17 and then again when I was 18, it was over a year ago and im still going to court for it. yesterday I sat in the court room for almost 5 hours just for them to give me another court date.

"So Im not that chubby, I just have a little flab on my stomach that I want to get rid of. The way Im trying to lose it is by counting the calories of what I eat, and trying to eat a minimum of 1,200 calories per day. And thats all fine and dandy, but when I try to talk to my parents about what Im trying to do, they just keep on saying that Im trying to hard, and that I need to just eat when Im hungry.I really want to lose that flab, and having my parents not support me that much is a bit discouraging. Can anyone bring my motivation back a little bit? ","So Im not that chubby, I just have a little flab on my stomach that I want to get rid of.

"He goes into a rage and starts calling me out of my name and berating me once again. He's telling me I'm trash, that's why I don't have a ring on my finger, all of my relationships in the future will result in men passing me around because I'm a grimy person. I fall for this trap and lose my shit and get into a verbal altercation with him. What made me really blow a gasket is when he tells me that he gave me another chance and I haven't changed my behavior. I hang up on him. I decided to call him later in the day and noticed my number was blocked. This isn't the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth time he's done this either. I get upset again, so I call his mother and tell her whats going on and state that I feel my son should not be going out of town with him because my partner has a habit of not answering phone calls because he's upset with me and I don't want my son out of town and I have no way of contacting any one to see how he's doing while he's away from me.","He goes into a rage and starts calling me out of my name and berating me once again.

"Hi reddit, I'm in serious need of some encouragement words or some advice. Anything will do really. I'm not very good at this but let's give it a try.I'm 24, recently had to quit my job in order to finish my thesis and being able to get my fucking college degree. My Job was very stressful but it was my only source of income, I think I made the right decision by quitting but I'm in a tough spot right now.As you can imagine, working on a thesis is no easy feat and as of this moment I feel incredibly anxious, depressed and overwhelmed. I'm short of time and even shorter on motivation and willingness to live. I have no other income than my savings and I'm living with my parents. I also have to spend ALL the fucking day alone, working on my thesis and taking care of myself.I just don't know what to do anymore and it is only making me more anxious and overwhelmed. If maybe some of you could give me some advice or encouraging words, that would be great!Thank you so much for reading.","Hi reddit, I'm in serious need of some encouragement words or some advice.

 Ok so I wasn't good enough at the ACT to get merit based scholarships and I wasn't poor enough to get need based scholarships. That means I'm paying for college with loans. I'm so dissapointed in myself I really thought I'd get a high enough ACT score for a merit based scholarship. Now everyone I telling me my life is ruined because I have student loans and everyone complains about how student loans are ruining their life. I'm going to school for nursing. I know I'll be ok academic wise but all the financial stuff is so discouraging. I just need to know I'll be ok. Everything is so uncertain and I feel like I've ruined my life., Ok so I wasn't good enough at the ACT to get merit based scholarships and I wasn't poor enough to get need based scholarships.

"Ive been on a downward spiralMy fianc and I have moved in together at the start of 2020, which either highlighted or exposed some major dependency issues that she has. On top of that, her mental health has been beyond terrible for herwhich is likely a huge driving force for the dependencyand Ive gotten Caregivers Fatigue 3 or 4 times already. I desperately want to communicate this issue but she can already read it off of me (been together for a long time) which is making her mental health worse at times, and I think if we were to outright have that conversation it would cause her mental health to be even worse. She also gets upset that it seems like I view her as helpless and unable to function without me, and admittedly I do because shes so extremely needyI hate myself physically. Literally from my head to my toes: I cant find a good haircut and the barber that I helped out with that couldnt be consistent, then COVID hit and Im out a barber & reference point for my hair. Im in too low of a funk to consistently care about maintaining my beard which is as frustrating as daily care would be. Ive been gaining fat all of 2020 which not only do I want to lose weight but Im also a nutrition major so thats not a good look.","Ive been on a downward spiralMy fianc and I have moved in together at the start of 2020, which either highlighted or exposed some major dependency issues that she has.

"I have a shitty job and a very unsupportive family. While having dinner, I told them about my plans to leave my full time job and build my own career on freelancing. Not even a minute in my explanation and theyve already bombarded me with a lot of questions and doubt.

Ive also saved enough money to live for a year which Im confident that Ill be able to get clients by then. It just hurts to know that none of the people I consider the closest to me support me in what I want to do. Its seriously taking a toll to my mental health. Ive been wanting to do this since last year but I just didnt have the right skills and financial stability yet. Now I know Im ready but it feels like its dragging me down with all the doubt that my family has around me. I easily get affected by what other people tell me which sucks big time. Im currently organizing my portfolio and other starting a freelancing career stuff right now and feeling really depressed. Uplift me please?

"And at that point,, i had spent so much time focusing on talents and being loved, that i lost my enjoyment. And once i lost my enjoyment,, there was nothing left. But people came to me,, they came to ME!! for art!! It was stunning, until i realized that that's all i was. A source of talent. They ripped those pieces I'd worked so hard for out of my hands and kicked me to the dirt. And from then on, the prices got bigger. I learned how to paint, i became the soloist of my choir, i learned to cook. Nothing was enough. Eventually, i even started offering money or items for love, and even my body.","And at that point,, i had spent so much time focusing on talents and being loved, that i lost my enjoyment.

Of note I'm married with a 6 moth old daughter.Well...I showed up to my first calculus test (I originally passed it with an 89.6 in 2002 but am retaking it to prepare for calculus II) and the teacher told us we couldn't use our calculators and to put them away. We all panic.  I didn't even finish the test.  Well, I just got back my grade and it's a 37/100 and I'm panicking thinking this was all a mistake quitting my career to go back to school just to try and find a career I was actually passionate about.

"Hello reddit strangers, I could use some encouragement this morning. I am fighting my demons and they are winning. I cant go to the hospital I would lose everything and truly have nothing to live for. Life without reason is no life, so if you say go to the hospital, I will put that in the just kill yourself category. I am in pain, such pain right now I am having trouble seeing that it will ever end.I met a girl before the crap happened, and we went out every week a few times each week for many months. There was a instant chemistry, it was like we had known each other for years. We laughed at the same jokes, we liked the same music, we were both sensual creatures with each other. We had such a great time together, laughing, making out, and just holding each other.We talked about the future, what we wanted to do together, places to visit, things to do, how our live would be together. We talked about getting a house together and cooking dinner and watching movies and playing with her daughter, we created a life that we both wanted.","Hello reddit strangers, I could use some encouragement this morning.

"I'm very much an introvert and I've let my reclusive tendencies really isolate and depress me for so long. I am a child of abusive and and equally very fearful and mistrusting of others. Depression has kept me hidden indoors, drinking too much and on youtube constantly. This semester has started off great. I've been attending all my university classes, working, working out everyday, and actively pursuing friendships with cool classmates. I've been feeling pretty great but also a little out of control I guess. I was having trouble turning off and sleeping but all was more or less well. I had an old friend stay with me for a couple of days and it was really the last straw for my new healthy life style. It's not like it wasn't fun or anything but with all the hard work I've been putting in making positive habits and then to have my friend around 24/7 for several days, I was just overwhelmed when they left. I hope that makes sense. Anyways, I ended up drinking a ton, passing out and missing all my responsibilities the next day. I have to get back out there, keep up all my positive changes but right now its really hard to want to leave my house. I feel depressed and scared. I could use some encouragement.","I'm very much an introvert and I've let my reclusive tendencies really isolate and depress me for so long.

This semester has started off great. I've been attending all my university classes, working, working out everyday, and actively pursuing friendships with cool classmates. I've been feeling pretty great but also a little out of control I guess. I was having trouble turning off and sleeping but all was more or less well. I had an old friend stay with me for a couple of days and it was really the last straw for my new healthy life style. It's not like it wasn't fun or anything but with all the hard work I've been putting in making positive habits and then to have my friend around 24/7 for several days, I was just overwhelmed when they left. I hope that makes sense. Anyways, I ended up drinking a ton, passing out and missing all my responsibilities the next day. I have to get back out there, keep up all my positive changes but right now its really hard to want to leave my house. I feel depressed and scared. I could use some encouragement."
"Im in desperate need of encouragement and advice or just anything positive. Im going through a very tough time in my life. My husbands cancer has spread and hell be having surgery this month. Hes staying with his Mom house in my hometown, so were living apart. We probably need to move back to my hometown after a year living hours away since our support system is there and since thats where my husbands team of doctors is based. My mom just died in March and because Im a contractor for my current job, they didnt pay me for the whole week and a half of work that I was out. So moneys been tight. I had to replace my tires recently. Work hasnt paid me back for my travel expenses. Now Im job hunting again and looking for new places to live. Im pretty broke, I cant visit my husband because the drive is so far and challenging and I only have less than 48 hours to make the trip. Im dealing with the loss of my mom, and how Im so unavailable because of my job, but I cant take a break from it because I wont get paid for it. Plus Im just feeling so shitty and unhappy with my body and Im just struggling so much. I know Ill be ok, but like...its just been bad day after bad day. Im a very positive person and have been handling this well, but Im having a spiral moment. Advice, encouragement and positivity are welcome.

"Going through a tough time in my life. 37F. My husband of 2 years walked out on me a month ago and filed for divorce. No cheating or major issues, just differences in values. I don't want the divorce. Other than this 2 year marriage, I have been single most of my adult life.My parents are both gone. I have a stepmother, but she and I have a very strained relationship and she is very critical of me and expresses her disapproval of how I do things all the time.  My father was my best friend. However, she's said a few things to me about how my father viewed me as having ""issues"".I have one brother, but we are not close. I do not have children.I have to wonder if there is something wrong with me. I feel I am the nicest person and quite easy to get along with. I have 4 excellent friends who are helping me hold everything together.I feel like I don't have anyone and I like I don't have any family. I have cried and hurt so much over my husband leaving that now I just don't care anymore. The hurts are piling on to where I just feel  indifferent.","Going through a tough time in my life. 37F.

"I recently got married, then my wife and I decided to foster, then we moved. All within a year and a half. We both use to be so active almost every day. I understand parenting is a priority but with this current child we literally cannot get out of the house. It's just too hard. I use to ride/run up to 20 miles a week and my wife use to run 10ish and do yoga 4 times a week. Now she is lucky to do yoga twice a month and I might get 30 minutes each week to run or ride. I'm kinda depressed, anxious about getting fat and catch myself slipping on my healthy foods. Wife feels the same. Im honestly just thinking about accepting my fate, buying larger clothes and just letting go.

If I hang out too often then she flips out on me. I'm afraid of moving out because I don't know the outcome of what will happen which ik won't be good.

"At the start of 2019, I was 190 pounds. This was the result of emotional eating, then starving myself years after I left a sexually and emotionally abusive relationship.One of my family members suggested her Paleo diet. All she eats is meat, and she lost over 20 pounds (good for her). If she eats anything else, though, she gets hella sick.I didn't want to give up my love of food, so when I met up with my girl friends from university, one of them said she was starting a calorie-limited diet and asked if I wanted to join her. You bet your sweet southern ass I did!We limited our calories to be around 1200 calories a day. A lot of days, I had little food, so I ate as much as I could to satisfy my stomach, even though it was 400-900 calories. Even now I still eat once or twice a day.Because I got a new phone, I can finally play Pokmon Go and have a reason to walk around town, so exercise is a thing!I don't have a weight scale, but I have two milestones I want to announce!1) Last semester, I bought a Steampunk dress off of Wish, followed by a casual, over the shoulder corset. Neither of them fit me, as I was much larger than I anticipated.","At the start of 2019, I was 190 pounds.

"Ive had some rough years before, or so I thought. 2018 has been a horrible year for my mental health. I dont know what happened, but Ive developed a seemingly unshakable hatred for my physical appearance, constantly nitpicking and tearing apart everything about myself. I recently had to decide to take a few steps away from alcohol, for a time, because Ive developed a tendency to use it as an escape from confronting any real issues I have, emotionally. Im staying up until 5 AM, Sleeping in until 3 PM, and staying inside with little to no motivation to do anything but shut myself away in my room and wait until I can sleep again.Theres something in me that refuses to believe my friends want to stay close, and something worse still that is agitated by the people who clearly show it. I know Im young, Im under no delusions that Im fully mature and that this is it, but I cant shake this feeling that Ill NEVER shake this. I have goals and dreams that I am actively sabotaging, and I need to stop. Its a lot to ask, I know, but could anyone offer some advice, or words of encouragement? Right now the idea that Ill fix myself up just seems completely alien to me.","Ive had some rough years before, or so I thought. 2018 has been a horrible year for my mental health.

"For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling.  I will walk before the Lord in the land of the living.Psalms 116:8-9 KJVThe psalmist often had to listen to the echo of their own prayers as they cried out to God from a place of isolation. Even if others are around, we can feel lonely if we forget that God is always there. We don't know who wrote Psalm 116, or in what circumstances, but the situation was dire (Seems hopeless). In verse Three he said the pain of death surrounded him and he found trouble and sorrow. During his isolation and fear, he called out to God, and beg God to deliver his soul (verse 4). But in verse 5 we find Gracious is the LORD, and righteous and merciful.No trouble is greater than God's power. Loneliness is a fiction since God is always with us. Call upon Him today and He will hear you, and draw near to you. Have a blessed day.   :)","For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling.

"Just need a little encouragement. A man threatened suicide when I told him I no longer wanted to date. I helped him get help and when I thought the situation deescalated, I left. He since has sent numerous texts and emails. Finally (much, much later when I thought this was over) he sent a 4-page letter to my house claiming that I caused all of the anxiety, depression, and desire to end it all. I filed a PFA (protection from abuse) against him. He is an abuser and its going to take a lot to be in the same room as him tomorrow - and to listen to him make up his version of reality, and to fight the protection I am seeking.I am hoping against hope that the judge believes me and is willing to grant this order to give me some peace of mind.UPDATE: abuser tried to outright lie and say I kept coming to his building so HE now wanted an order against ME. My incredible lawyer was not having any of that - and I was granted the order. Thank you everyone for your encouragement. I am so relieved","Just need a little encouragement.

Dogs love is unconditional, always there for you, always glad to see you, ready to forgive you, love going places with you, will protect you from danger, and on and on. We would be fortunate to have a human friend who is faithful as a canine friend. Actually, we do have such a friend and such more than a four legged friend. That friend is Jesus and He understands everything we go through in life. Jesus can sympathize with our weaknesses. Human friends may disappoint us, but Jesus never will. He is a friend that ""sticks closer than a brother "" (Proverbs 18:24). Have a blessed weekend.  :)","Hello, im not sure if i will continue to share my encouraging thought because people have been having problems because i use my faith to try to help people i was asked to only post everyother day because apperently im offending people, i dont understand why this offends anyone, if you dont want to read it then dont.

We would be fortunate to have a human friend who is faithful as a canine friend. Actually, we do have such a friend and such more than a four legged friend. That friend is Jesus and He understands everything we go through in life. Jesus can sympathize with our weaknesses. Human friends may disappoint us, but Jesus never will. He is a friend that ""sticks closer than a brother "" (Proverbs 18:24). Have a blessed weekend.  :)"
"Not really any support from him. Dad and mom were a little more understanding. They told me to essentially fix what I did wrong and try to make up for it. But it wasnt really true support more like them just saying things to make me feel better. Most of my friends found out what happened, and essentially dropped me and now Im alone fighting for something. So whats been going on since I dropped medicinal school?:Around July I applied to a masters in biomedical sciences at NOVA. This was a specialized program in Florida aimed to help student with below standards to boost their application into medical school or dental school. You needed a minimum of a 2.5 gpa to apply and this was my last chance to get into medical school as if you got in and completed the program you were able to receive an interview to their medical school.","Not really any support from him.

"Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.James 1:27 KJVHere something I read that I like to share. ""A California newspaper recently published a picture of a note scribbled by woman named Wanda. She slid it under the front door of her neighbor, whose name she did not even know. The note said: Mrs. ? Would you consider to become my friend? I'm 90 years old - live alone and all my friends have passed away. I am so lonesome and scared. Please - I pray for someone. Thankfully the neighbor, Marleen Brooks, found the note and went right over to Wanda's house with cupcakes, and the two have formed a wonderful friendship. Furthermore, Marleen has campaigned on social media to encourage others to be on the lookout  for lonely neighbors who live right next door.""Some of us simply need to look next door, down the street, and into the nursing homes, hospitals and retirement communities. People need people, and people who need people often need the Lord. So let us  pray to God for someone you can bless.

"But now Im lying to them: saying that I have a ship date for July. When really, I dont. I talked to other recruiters, AF and Marines and theyre encouraging saying as soon as I get my discharge letter they can process me. I need to get out of my home as soon as possible. Forget college at this point. My mother and I actually had the start of a fist fight the other day.(She grabbed my phone and when I grabbed it back she upper cut my nose.) I cant live with my boyfriend because he doesnt have room in the apartment he shares with three other people and his lease isnt up until February. I dont have a car in my name. I dont have money- I have exactly $110. The friends I do have are not in a position to let me crash at their places. I dont have family or grandparents close, or whom I have a relationship with.(We moved far away when I was a kid.)","But now Im lying to them: saying that I have a ship date for July.

"A lot of people have told me that most people fail their first time, but it really doesn't make me feel better about it. The lady testing me tried to get me to reschedule for Monday (which has already passed) but i wanted to see my school councilor about it first. Unfortunately, this week is the dreaded standardized testing week so I don't think I'm gonna be able to see her, and I honestly don't think I can handle my job any longer. I'm really stuck between a rock and a hard place here. On one hand: i really need to take that next step forward towards the plan I have going, but I also feel so so embarassed and i don't want to see that lady again because she had to see me cry. I'd go to a different driving school but I'd have to pay more at a new place than I'd have to for a retake. My only real choice here is to stand up and do it.Can anyone please give me the encouragement to call back and try again next week? I really need it.","A lot of people have told me that most people fail their first time, but it really doesn't make me feel better about it.

"A little background. I'm 36, male, 290lbs, and found out that I'm diabetic about a year and a half ago.  I'm still overweight and trying the Atkins diet now.  I have been recording my walks to track them to see if I'm improving on my time. Today I pushed myself a little bit harder and tracked a 14 minute and 17 seconds mile. So far that's my fastest mile pace. I was very proud of this achievement because it's been awhile since I've gotten under 15 minutes. Not really looking for any type of advice to make it better just a little bit of encouragement that I didn't receive when I got home. Thanks.","A little background.

"So...Today I was planning on giving myself a pizza birthday with anyone who wanted to join on my campus. I only have two friends. I got a check for $100 yesterday that I cashed and I have been looking forward to this all week. Even after my birthday that happened this past Wednesday. I had some bills to pay like hulu and neflix which I didn't mind. But i made sure that I was saving enough to I could buy the stuff. I got on the bus. Got some drinks for myself and I got two bracelets from hot topic too but what I didn't realize was that most of my billing stuff happened today. So I went from $60 to $8 cause I didn't know my netflix bill and hulu bill happened today. So after I bought drinks and two cool bracelets for myself, I didn't have enough money to buy my pizzas. I was at target and I had put two digornio's stuffed cheese pizzas in my cart and I was trying to check my bank finances cause I always get paranoid that money is going to disappear. But I had $40 after I bought my bracelets.","So...Today I was planning on giving myself a pizza birthday with anyone who wanted to join on my campus. I only have two friends.

I know this may sound irrational but I cant help feel that there is something wrong with me and that Im screwed up and thats why this happened to me.

On top of all this, I had a falling out with one of my best friends and he turned some of my other friends against me.

She said the reason she doesnt want to make our relationship anything more is because she doesnt want to destroy the relationship we have right now. I dont know how true that actually is.

"I've taken on a 3-year university course that is said to be really tough, but it's something I'm truly interested in. The thing about this university is that there is no project work, no presentation or participation points to help my grade- EVERYTHING is based on the results of a year-end exam. Last year, I failed ALL my modules and had to resit them, which makes me one year behind. This year, I managed to clear two of my toughest modules, but I failed the other two, which means that I now will take 5 years to graduate.My parents and friends are telling me not to beat myself up over it, but I can't help but feel so, so disappointed that I did not pass everything. I had such expectations for myself too.I guess I really feel insecure about graduating a lot later than everyone else I know. I feel really depressed that I can't do well in something that I like.","I've taken on a 3-year university course that is said to be really tough, but it's something I'm truly interested in.

"I do enjoy health and wellness so why not? I'm also getting my NASM Personal training certificate and could use an easy side job. I initially started this job April of this year and at first it was incredibly easy being back in retail. Then due to a series of events it got incredibly difficult. No working registers for 4 months, no support from managers, and co-workers who didn't like me. Slowly but surely I realized that it was taking time away from my goals when the whole reason I took the job was to put my goals first. I came into work yesterday, and the last week had been horrible. Total store reset, computers crashing, and no communication from management. I'd decided to make the best of it and do the best I could. When I got in the two workers who don't particularly like me started to correct me on tasks that couldn't be completed yesterday due to computers crashing. Telling me it's no excuse. I just stood there in awe, in all this chaos you have a worker who comes in with a good attitude, does her best given the circumstances, and instead of saying ""Hey!","I do enjoy health and wellness so why not?

I am a struggling makeup student for 3 years and I finally got my first paid job for working on set for a short film. I was extremely anxious over it and stayed in a hotel for 4 days just to get some work experience which I never thought I could do this early on in my course. I did it and smashed it and I wasnt tagged in the promo post by the director who is also a student btw when he tagged everyone else. My parents werent too fussed either. I thought this was gonna be this massive achievement but now I feel like maybe I shouldnt feel so proud of myself as I am.,I am a struggling makeup student for 3 years and I finally got my first paid job for working on set for a short film.

"I recently finished a BSc in biology (the thought-process was to start off in biology, and segway into vet-school after a couple of years). I ended up changing my mind about vet-school pretty early into my bachelor's, and that's when I started thinking about changing my major to something artsy (I had always had a passion for writing). What stopped me from doing that was the unintentional (at least, I think it was) pressure my family and relatives put on me; out of all 6 grandchildren, I was the only one who was doing significantly well in university; my two older cousins both dropped out of their undergrad after about 5 weeks, because they couldn't cope with the level of difficulty (I'm not in any way throwing shade, people can choose to do whatever they want in their lives and I honestly couldn't give less of a flying fig). Anyway, I was continuously being flooded with words of encouragement from my relatives, and they very quickly stopped calling me by my name, and instead started calling me ""the biologist"". And, although the encouragement made me feel good about myself, I couldn't help but start to feel trapped in my academic path: ""I'm the only one of the grandchildren who's academically inclined, the others have shown absolutely no interest in pursuing a university degree...Hell, they've nicknamed me 'the biologist', I can't stop now, I'll surely let everybody down"". So, I finished my biology degree (nothing fancy, no co-op, no job waiting for me when I graduated, nothing), but now I've been thinking about getting a Master's in literature, or fine arts, or English (in about 3 years). I'm still scared that I would be making a stupid mistake by choosing a MA instead of a MSc, and that I would regret it, especially since I don't even believe my writing is that good.","I recently finished a BSc in biology (the thought-process was to start off in biology, and segway into vet-school after a couple of years).

What stopped me from doing that was the unintentional (at least, I think it was) pressure my family and relatives put on me; out of all 6 grandchildren, I was the only one who was doing significantly well in university; my two older cousins both dropped out of their undergrad after about 5 weeks, because they couldn't cope with the level of difficulty (I'm not in any way throwing shade, people can choose to do whatever they want in their lives and I honestly couldn't give less of a flying fig). Anyway, I was continuously being flooded with words of encouragement from my relatives, and they very quickly stopped calling me by my name, and instead started calling me ""the biologist"". And, although the encouragement made me feel good about myself, I couldn't help but start to feel trapped in my academic path: ""I'm the only one of the grandchildren who's academically inclined, the others have shown absolutely no interest in pursuing a university degree...Hell, they've nicknamed me 'the biologist', I can't stop now, I'll surely let everybody down"". So, I finished my biology degree (nothing fancy, no co-op, no job waiting for me when I graduated, nothing), but now I've been thinking about getting a Master's in literature, or fine arts, or English (in about 3 years). I'm still scared that I would be making a stupid mistake by choosing a MA instead of a MSc, and that I would regret it, especially since I don't even believe my writing is that good."
"Hi everyone,I'm feeling sad and could really use some encouragement. I've been on and off slightly sick for weeks, just body aches and fatigue that lasts only a day. Well, a few days ago I had that again, along with a minor fever, but this time the symptoms have lasted several days. It is totally bearable, but I am just feeling really emotional and tired of being sick. Today my fever is a little worse, and on top of that, I'm in grad school and my current class has us reading several readings a day plus long blog posts. I'm tired of having to read all day, write a long blog post, and being sick on top of that. I just want to lay in bed all day and relax, nap, and cry a little. I apologize if this post is too ""complain-y"" and I know there are much more important things in the world than me being tired of being sick. I am so thankful that I can do school from home and not have to go out for work, especially with the pandemic going on. I am also thankful that my symptoms are not as bad as many people right now, but I am also really scared that this might lowkey be covid and the symptoms will ramp up. I could just use some encouragement right now.","Hi everyone,I'm feeling sad and could really use some encouragement.

"Thursday I got let go from my job. In the last three years since moving to Portland I have lost every job Ive had. The career Ive been working in I am burnt out in. I know that if I get a job in this same career, its just going to happen again. I have a wife and two kids and I just kinda need some random strangers to tell me things will be okay long enough for me to actually believe it.","Thursday I got let go from my job.

"I met her very young daughter and fell in love with them even more quickly. She told me she loved me and wanted a future with me. We promised that if it wasnt working out we would tell each other and not just ghost the other, we did a pinky swear that we would not breakup over text, that we would not ghost each other as it had happened to us both, we would show each other the love we feel in that moment as a promise.We did OK for the few weeks after she was laid off and we couldnt go out as much. I tried to help with as much money as I could, but as the weeks progressed I started to feel like an ATM again, she stopped texting, she stopped calling, only when it was time for me to give money would she come back, now we have slowly drifted apart more she didn't come back last week when i got paid. And now I dont feel anything is left. She has been distant for a long time now, not texting or answering calls. She only said she has shit going on but nothing more. She doesnt say I love you anymore, she doesnt even say hi or I miss you. It is as if I dreamed her and I am waking up from that dream again, and she was never real.I feel that I have been just dropped yet again, but this time I let my heart believe it was different.","I met her very young daughter and fell in love with them even more quickly.

"Ive been on a downward spiralMy fianc and I have moved in together at the start of 2020, which either highlighted or exposed some major dependency issues that she has. On top of that, her mental health has been beyond terrible for herwhich is likely a huge driving force for the dependencyand Ive gotten Caregivers Fatigue 3 or 4 times already. I desperately want to communicate this issue but she can already read it off of me (been together for a long time) which is making her mental health worse at times, and I think if we were to outright have that conversation it would cause her mental health to be even worse. She also gets upset that it seems like I view her as helpless and unable to function without me, and admittedly I do because shes so extremely needyI hate myself physically. Literally from my head to my toes: I cant find a good haircut and the barber that I helped out with that couldnt be consistent, then COVID hit and Im out a barber &amp; reference point for my hair. Im in too low of a funk to consistently care about maintaining my beard which is as frustrating as daily care would be. Ive been gaining fat all of 2020 which not only do I want to lose weight but Im also a nutrition major so thats not a good look.","Ive been on a downward spiralMy fianc and I have moved in together at the start of 2020, which either highlighted or exposed some major dependency issues that she has.

I get so nervous that my mouth becomes dry, palms sweat, feet shake and I just cant get my mind straight. I am so mad because of that.

"Soooo as title says I have costed out the machines I need for my potential new business venture (side hustle to start) and hopefully one day it will take off as main income.  Ive found what I need and it $15k shipped from China. Other supplier is in Germany but they want 39,000 for same equipment to be shipped. I cant afford German stuff. But I can afford the Chinese version. Now it all looks very comparable online. My thing is do I take the gamble and buy the Chinese machine? I can afford it if it actually turns up and works as promised. But I cant afford to be ripped off and it not turn up or it breaks the first time I use it. Should I take my chances or keep the money in the bank?

He proceeds to slap my phone off of my stand in my car and stomp on it. I become irate and start telling him how I didn't appreciate him destroying property. We get back to his mother's house and she can tell something is wrong with me. So, I ask to speak to her one on one to show her what he did to my phone.

"Going through a tough time in my life. 37F. My husband of 2 years walked out on me a month ago and filed for divorce. No cheating or major issues, just differences in values. I don't want the divorce. Other than this 2 year marriage, I have been single most of my adult life.My parents are both gone. I have a stepmother, but she and I have a very strained relationship and she is very critical of me and expresses her disapproval of how I do things all the time.  My father was my best friend. However, she's said a few things to me about how my father viewed me as having ""issues"".I have one brother, but we are not close. I do not have children.I have to wonder if there is something wrong with me. I feel I am the nicest person and quite easy to get along with. I have 4 excellent friends who are helping me hold everything together.I feel like I don't have anyone and I like I don't have any family. I have cried and hurt so much over my husband leaving that now I just don't care anymore. The hurts are piling on to where I just feel  indifferent.","Going through a tough time in my life. 37F.

"First, a bit of context. I'm 15 (close to 16) and have mild autism.

"So, I've been best friends for a year and a half with a girl(I am a guy) and I'm talking the kind of friendship that we can tell each other anything and everything and know that the other isn't going to judge and is just there to listen and give advice.In November I finally told her that I had feelings for her after debating in my head for 4 months. She said she also had feelings for me and we were proud of each other for finally letting it out. However, ever since then it feels like there is a rift in the friendship that I had zero intention of creating, you see, I never fully wanted to get into a relationship as she had just started her freshman year of college and I am in my Junior year of highschool(we're only a year apart in age) so we were both stressed with school. I was just tired of holding it in and wanted to get it off my chest.As it stands now, we still talk but it's not the same. It's not the deep talks we used to have, she won't talk to me about anything that's bothering her, and there is something, she's said so multiple times, I just can't get her to open up anymore. I don't know what I did or how to fix it and it's driving me crazy and it's making me feel like giving up on everything. She's the kind of friend that I really don't want to lose and would rather keep as a best friend than ruin that by getting into a relationship. If anyone has any advice at all, it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.Update: She has a bf and hast spoken to me in almost 3 months. Thanks for all the advice, I've just given up at this point.","So, I've been best friends for a year and a half with a girl(I am a guy) and I'm talking the kind of friendship that we can tell each other anything and everything and know that the other isn't going to judge and is just there to listen and give advice.In November I finally told her that I had feelings for her after debating in my head for 4 months.

"Ive been having toenail issues for about a year now, which tops it off for the head to toe partIm unemployed right now and couldnt get unemployment, so thats really rough. Im really thankful that money isnt as big of an issue as it would be for most people, but I find myself sitting in my car in a random parking lot just to get out of the house. I legit lost all of my friends in 2019 with not even the slightest explanation. Ghosted by my college friends when I had a family medical emergency and had to withdraw from school, and my best friend blocked me on everything in December. The only explanation I can think of for getting blocked is that she was hoping this guy (who she said had major insecurity issues) would ask her out, and my assumption is that he made her block me.Student loans are beating me down because I dont know if its financially worth it to shoot for my dream. What good is it if I have to work a job in addition to my career just to pay off my loans?Im just having a rough time, and its getting to me","Ive been having toenail issues for about a year now, which tops it off for the head to toe partIm unemployed right now and couldnt get unemployment, so thats really rough.

"Ive been on a downward spiralMy fianc and I have moved in together at the start of 2020, which either highlighted or exposed some major dependency issues that she has. On top of that, her mental health has been beyond terrible for herwhich is likely a huge driving force for the dependencyand Ive gotten Caregivers Fatigue 3 or 4 times already. I desperately want to communicate this issue but she can already read it off of me (been together for a long time) which is making her mental health worse at times, and I think if we were to outright have that conversation it would cause her mental health to be even worse. She also gets upset that it seems like I view her as helpless and unable to function without me, and admittedly I do because shes so extremely needyI hate myself physically. Literally from my head to my toes: I cant find a good haircut and the barber that I helped out with that couldnt be consistent, then COVID hit and Im out a barber & reference point for my hair. Im in too low of a funk to consistently care about maintaining my beard which is as frustrating as daily care would be. Ive been gaining fat all of 2020 which not only do I want to lose weight but Im also a nutrition major so thats not a good look.","Ive been on a downward spiralMy fianc and I have moved in together at the start of 2020, which either highlighted or exposed some major dependency issues that she has.

"Long post,I suffer from neurological and mental disorders and have always had trouble keeping work. I'm in an affordable city ( Montreal ) but really want to go, but everywhere I look it all seems even more expensive than it was.Toronto is not doable, Hamilton has gone up a lot too. I could really only afford a shared apartment on minimum wage ( if I could keep the job ) and disability isn't enough for a 1 bedroom either. Living with others can be very stressful, of course not as stressful as being homeless, I know I was once for a short time.I just feel so depressed being poor and mentally ill in Canada, like the raising rent and costs of food, ect makes it no longer a place for poor people, minimum wage workers. I'm just alone in this big city, no license, no job, and the Covid19 situation makes it hard for me to connect to communities, to feel like I have a future. There are only a few places left that are affordable for low income people in Canada, and those places have high unemployment and are car dependent. I guess I wish I knew someone who was struggling financially and mentally ill, I'm so alone and scared in my own country.TLDR:I'm really scared living in Canada and being poor and mentally ill with the high rent, car dependent cities, and Covid affecting the economy.","Long post,I suffer from neurological and mental disorders and have always had trouble keeping work.

The lady testing me tried to get me to reschedule for Monday (which has already passed) but i wanted to see my school councilor about it first. Unfortunately, this week is the dreaded standardized testing week so I don't think I'm gonna be able to see her, and I honestly don't think I can handle my job any longer. I'm really stuck between a rock and a hard place here. On one hand: i really need to take that next step forward towards the plan I have going, but I also feel so so embarassed and i don't want to see that lady again because she had to see me cry. I'd go to a different driving school but I'd have to pay more at a new place than I'd have to for a retake. My only real choice here is to stand up and do it.Can anyone please give me the encouragement to call back and try again next week?

"I was thinking that maybe I could try something interesting. Somewhere in the first week of each month I would change the banner to a new encouraging quote or inspirational photo. I really find it fun. So if anyone here has a particular quote or photo that they particularly like and would like to share, I will try my best to find an image of that quote or photo that fits the banner size requirements and change it accordingly for old Reddit, new Reddit, and the mobile version. Or, if you have an actual photo already of your quote/photo setting, comment it via a photo-hosting site of your choice (or PM if you prefer).If you don't really have a preference, I shall pick something I think is nice enough to be the new banner. I'll see how long I can keep this going, and while I might not consistently change the banner every month, I will do the best I can to do it regularly. Thanks.","I was thinking that maybe I could try something interesting. Somewhere in the first week of each month I would change the banner to a new encouraging quote or inspirational photo.

"Just need a little encouragement. A man threatened suicide when I told him I no longer wanted to date. I helped him get help and when I thought the situation deescalated, I left. He since has sent numerous texts and emails. Finally, he sent a 4-page letter to my house claiming that I caused all of the anxiety, depression, and desire to end it all. I filed a PFA (protection from abuse) against him. He is an abuser and its going to take a lot to be in the same room as him tomorrow - and to listen to him make up his version of reality, and to fight the protection I am seeking.I am hoping against hope that the judge believes me and is willing to grant this order to give me some peace of mind.","Just need a little encouragement.

Finally, he sent a 4-page letter to my house claiming that I caused all of the anxiety, depression, and desire to end it all. I filed a PFA (protection from abuse) against him. He is an abuser and its going to take a lot to be in the same room as him tomorrow - and to listen to him make up his version of reality, and to fight the protection I am seeking.I am hoping against hope that the judge believes me and is willing to grant this order to give me some peace of mind."

"Long post,I suffer from neurological and mental disorders and have always had trouble keeping work. I'm in an affordable city ( Montreal ) but really want to go, but everywhere I look it all seems even more expensive than it was.Toronto is not doable, Hamilton has gone up a lot too. I could really only afford a shared apartment on minimum wage ( if I could keep the job ) and disability isn't enough for a 1 bedroom either. Living with others can be very stressful, of course not as stressful as being homeless, I know I was once for a short time.I just feel so depressed being poor and mentally ill in Canada, like the raising rent and costs of food, ect makes it no longer a place for poor people, minimum wage workers. I'm just alone in this big city, no license, no job, and the Covid19 situation makes it hard for me to connect to communities, to feel like I have a future. There are only a few places left that are affordable for low income people in Canada, and those places have high unemployment and are car dependent. I guess I wish I knew someone who was struggling financially and mentally ill, I'm so alone and scared in my own country.TLDR:I'm really scared living in Canada and being poor and mentally ill with the high rent, car dependent cities, and Covid affecting the economy.","Long post,I suffer from neurological and mental disorders and have always had trouble keeping work.

"I grew up in a home where the only point of existing as a girl was to get married, be a good wife and have kids.

It doesnt matter that Ive moved alone, found a job to support myself, had to learn absolutely everything on my own.  My mom doesnt care and wonders why I wont just settle for a guy who will make money. That guy has never come along and I didnt have the option of being homeless and jobless.Yesterday I finally researched in detail about ux (user interaction) design. I finally learned about the process and how I could start this path.For the first time this year I have felt hopeful. Its been such a bad year, so many horrible things happened. I had a legit near death experience a few months ago and had to deal with legal research and consequences of that.For the first time I feel hopeful even though Im alone and have no one to be happy for me.","I grew up in a home where the only point of existing as a girl was to get married, be a good wife and have kids.

"I want to live with the hope that technology will advance enough that we will be able to rejuvenate ourselves indefinitely. Of course we will still be able of dying of non-age related causes, but at least it'll mean we are not in some kind of countdown. I hate when people say things like 'life is short'. It just makes it sound like I have to hurry everything in my lifestyle and can't take it slow, what a way to do things fast and bad. You can't hurry art!I'd say it's not completely baseless, as there seems to be experiments on rejuvenation already, and I'm in my middle 20s. Of course it does not mean I'm going to live my life carelessly or let it pass me. I already am pretty active to do my best and achieve everything I want to achieve.

"Sorry in advance for the book. So my life has basically been drastically changing in a very short amount of time. I (23/F) am from and currently live in Tampa, FL. I recently graduated with my AA and am moving onto my Bachelors at USF. I recently found out that USF Tampa doesnt have my major, Photojournalism, at their campus, but that USF St. Pete (an hour away) would be better suited for what Im looking for. I also just got fired from my bartending job, which is 10 minutes from my house, but a friend of mine just got hired at a bar in St. Pete and said theyre looking for a female bartender, but I live with my boyfriend in Tampa, who is coincidentally  refusing to tell me whether he would be willing to move to St. Pete for me, saying thinking about it would just cause him unnecessary stress, that he doesnt need to think about it until the time comes. But, I did just come out as Bisexual and have been really wanting to explore a relationship with a female. So on paper, this is all meant to be, right?But why do I get overwhelmingly sad and anxious every time I think about how my life is basically crumbling to nothing.","Sorry in advance for the book.

"Hey all, so I've been going through a bit of a rough time these past years and I'm really starting to have a hard time seing the end of it all. Ever since I stopped being an athlete 4 years ago it just seems like its all downhill from there. I mean, I guess I really can't complain because my professional is doing pretty good, but I really really can't get the social stuff in order. I think I'm pretty good at being nice and welcoming because I tend to get along with people well. My problem is that people just don't end up caring about me as much as I care about them. So I just end up fading away from everyone's life slowly but surely. This week I got kicked out and insulted from a group of friends for something that they think I did but that I did not. They never even bothered to talk to me or hear my end of anything. So I basically had to watch my only friends start hating me through no fault of my own.Dating has been a shit show... In the past I've had girls laugh at me, hit me or sleep with some of my friends behind my back. I've only been in one relationship that got cut dry shortly after its beginning for her being uncomfortable to be in a relationship with someone at school before going apeshit for isolating myself and going into depression. Now she hates me and became best friend with one my then best friend. I think they are even going out now.I've been seing a psychologist for 2 years now on a weekly basis and it still keeps me there...I've been taking antidepressants for 2 months now and they havent seemed to help much. I'm trying so hard to be the best version of myself but it is really hard.I'm just so tired... anybody got a bit of good words to spare","Hey all, so I've been going through a bit of a rough time these past years and I'm really starting to have a hard time seing the end of it all.

"When we started dating 5 years ago, I told her how much I wanted children. She said she could want kids with me.    Apparently, she's changed her mind and doesn't want kids at all now, and I just don't think I could be fulfilled without children. I don't want to lose her and our dog. I just feel so bad right now.","When we started dating 5 years ago, I told her how much I wanted children. She said she could want kids with me.

"Im an american and i go to college at NYUs campus in Shanghai. Yes, Shanghai China. My semester was postponed to February 17th due to the coronavirus and I went from being fully convinced this past Monday that I would eventually return to Shanghai, to me moving into my dorm in NYC for a semester there tomorrow morning. I had to stay awake until 4 am every night this week because Im in the US and the emails informing us on the situation came in on shanghai time, a full 13 hour difference. All the while still having to go to work each day. Needless to say the past 5 days have stripped a month off ky lifespan just so I can scramble a semester free of epidemics out of this mess somehow. My ordeal is nowhere near done either because the corona situation has NYU in such shambles that they havent even figured out how to fit the humdreds of shanghai students now coming to new york a week late into classes. Im literally moving into my dorm room with no knowledge of wether I will get registered for ANY classes, let alone the ones I want or need to progress towards my degree. Not to mention I have so much stuff in a dorm room across the planet with no means of getting it because none of my friends will be there to get them either. Any kind words to help me persevere through this situation right now would be amazing. Bless you all.","Im an american and i go to college at NYUs campus in Shanghai. Yes, Shanghai China.

There is nothing wrong with you. Just keep trying and give yourself a break. We are all just kids in adult bodies. Be nice to yourself at the very least.

"My relationship with my mom has been a contentious one that has been brewing for a long time. I've been grappling with moving out, knowing full well she would never approve, and likely choose to disown me. A few days ago, we fought, and she gave me an ultimatum to move out by the end of the month. There's so much going on inside my mind - anxiety that our relationship will be irreparable, that this is a terrible and unsafe time to move (covid and right before the holidays), of whether I am good enough/mentally strong enough to live alone, if I will be able to find a place in time. Does it make the beast less terrible if I understand my beast? I'm deeply worried, and I'm hoping that someone can point me in the right direction and tell me about a time it all worked out for them.","My relationship with my mom has been a contentious one that has been brewing for a long time.

"Hey, 18 F here. I have pretty bad anxiety and i finally got the courage to schedule my driver's test a few weeks ago. I studied my heart out, took 11 pages of notes on the driver's manual, and i thought i was ready. But I missed a stop sign and that's an automatic failure. I never even saw the damn thing because there was a tree branch in the way, and ended up missing a second one because I sort of went into a panicked state and shut down. When I parked and the lady told me a failed, i started bawling and I ended up crying all the way home and for a few hours after that. My dad (bless his heart) ended up having to call me out of work because when the time came around I was still crying and refused to get out of bed. Having a license is a really big thing for me because it's the next step in becoming completely independent and the bridge toward being able to finally quit my shitty job, move out, and get away from my kind of abusive mom.","Hey, 18 F here.

"My sister in law expressed that she wanted me out last night. After they encourage me to go to my best friend's wedding in another state and get involved in a local sport (which cost money), I was informed that she was pissed that I had bought sports equipment the other night and that it was becoming time for me to leave. She wasn't mean about it. She just stated that it was time for her to have her space back. I'm worried that after all the changes I have been making, I'm back where I started. I'm in a job that can't sustain me financially. I don't know how I'm going to afford my bills if I move out by February. I know that I can't work any more than 4 days a week with my current class load and my mental health issues. I can't get treatment now because I can't afford to pay for it. And I'd be lying if I didn't say I feel like the rug has been pulled from out beneath me. Maybe they thought I was doing better than I was actually doing. The truth is that talking about my illness stresses out my SIL. My brother offered to listen but every time I try to talk to him he just walks away.

The truth is that talking about my illness stresses out my SIL. My brother offered to listen but every time I try to talk to him he just walks away. So I've only been telling them good things."
"Ive been on a downward spiralMy fianc and I have moved in together at the start of 2020, which either highlighted or exposed some major dependency issues that she has. On top of that, her mental health has been beyond terrible for herwhich is likely a huge driving force for the dependencyand Ive gotten Caregivers Fatigue 3 or 4 times already. I desperately want to communicate this issue but she can already read it off of me (been together for a long time) which is making her mental health worse at times, and I think if we were to outright have that conversation it would cause her mental health to be even worse. She also gets upset that it seems like I view her as helpless and unable to function without me, and admittedly I do because shes so extremely needyI hate myself physically. Literally from my head to my toes: I cant find a good haircut and the barber that I helped out with that couldnt be consistent, then COVID hit and Im out a barber &amp; reference point for my hair. Im in too low of a funk to consistently care about maintaining my beard which is as frustrating as daily care would be. Ive been gaining fat all of 2020 which not only do I want to lose weight but Im also a nutrition major so thats not a good look.","Ive been on a downward spiralMy fianc and I have moved in together at the start of 2020, which either highlighted or exposed some major dependency issues that she has.

"A big question I think a lot of people are asking these days is why are we so depressed, why are we so anxious. We are more anxious and depressed these days because of our culture. With the internet and media we are under a microscope and we are constantly being pressured to be perfect. Perfect body, perfect skin, perfect routine, perfect eating habits, the way you sleep, the way the way you stand, the way you parent, perfect fulfilled fun lives. Every single thing we do we are pressured with the fact that we arent good enough. We arent doing it right. We arent doing it perfectly. We live in an illusion that some people are but its all just a magic trick. People put on a fake face. No one truly knows whats real anymore, so we sit there thinking we arent good enough, we arent as good as everyone else. We have access to all the bad news around the world like never  before. So on top of being perfect we have things like global warming, the entire world that needs to be fixed to worry about too. So let me just say this...Slow down. You will not be perfect. You will not live those glamorous lives you think are real. Just stop striving for perfect and start striving for your best, you will never fall short. Work hard, love hard, and take care of yourself.","A big question I think a lot of people are asking these days is why are we so depressed, why are we so anxious.

"Hi all, I'm a nurse, working in the time of Covid. All politics aside, its just a really hard time to be a nurse. Long hours, frayed tempers, everyone is on edge. I'm just fried, and I miss my coping mechanisms of pedicures, massages, and spa days. They've been replaced by activities like hiking and meditation - its fun, but it's not what I really want. I come from a big family. We must update each other every week on how we have been. Negative points if you don't make the weekly Skype. Even more negative if you dont 'bring it'and show how you are 'crushing Covid.'I'm so tired. I have about 10% gas left in my tank. I just need a smile, or a nod, or a 'sup' just to say that regardless of where we are, it's going to be okay.","Hi all, I'm a nurse, working in the time of Covid.

"So I knew I had enough....but when I saw I only had $8. My heart sank....because....I'm the type of person who never buys anything for myself because I have always been broke.

"Looks like the depression and disappointment hit me post midnight, as Im currently up at 5 am typing this. You know when only *one* small thing goes wrong then suddenly youre all up in a rut about every life decision youve made? Well, Im feeling really shitty about the fact that technically I allowed two things of my own possession to get slightly damaged, all in one night. Due to being lazy in bed, I asked my dad to shake my lava lamp to let the floating hardened liquid to sink towards the bottom. He shook it too hard, causing the whole thing to fall apart and for the lightbulb to lose one of its connector pieces. He said hed go to the hardware store soon to replace the lightbulb, but Im in slight doubt if the lamp will work after that, feeling that its my fault, in technical aspects. This is going to also sound ridiculous, but my new phone (no case, no screen protector) somehow slid off the surface I placed it on while doing something this late at night, causing it to hit the hard floor screen first, getting itself some small scratches on its corners in the process. I know the scratches arent that bad, but my obsessive compulsive disorder really tests my tolerance when it comes to the smallest things. And it was a new phone that Ive only had for a couple of weeks, for crying out loud! Ive just been self deprecating for the past two hours, so far.In sum from all of this, how do I effectively diminish the thought of I could have done this to prevent this or that so I can learn from these small situations that have been bothering me for the past couple of hours? I guess I somehow have a compass as to how I can solve this, but hearing something from somebody else would really encourage me.","Looks like the depression and disappointment hit me post midnight, as Im currently up at 5 am typing this.

I'm enjoying learning but failing that bad has me in panic mode.  I already struggle with depression and I'm hoping to benefit from talking with someone about it.  I don't feel like I can talk to my wife about it. :("
"Not kissing her, not being in love. Not seeing future thanksgiving, or Christmas, not seeing that future life we said we both wanted. I die more each time I wake up from that dream life; the pain gets worse; my chest physically hurts right now as I am so heartbroken.I could live with her telling me its not working and she is breaking up with me, that would hurt but its the unknown, the not knowing for sure that she doesnt want me and the why. But I know logically silence is an answer, but how can someone say they love you then be so mean and just drop you from their life, that is not love.I would give anything I have to be held right now, just to be held, to feel wanted, to feel loved, and maybe even be together and remember what being alive means. I am going to try to sleep for a while, I am so tired, maybe my heart will just stop while I sleep and the pain of waking up wont happen, I can only wish it would happen. Can someone really die like that from heartbreak? I only wish it would happen. So tired of everything right now.","Not kissing her, not being in love.

"Ive had some rough years before, or so I thought. 2018 has been a horrible year for my mental health. I dont know what happened, but Ive developed a seemingly unshakable hatred for my physical appearance, constantly nitpicking and tearing apart everything about myself. I recently had to decide to take a few steps away from alcohol, for a time, because Ive developed a tendency to use it as an escape from confronting any real issues I have, emotionally. Im staying up until 5 AM, Sleeping in until 3 PM, and staying inside with little to no motivation to do anything but shut myself away in my room and wait until I can sleep again.Theres something in me that refuses to believe my friends want to stay close, and something worse still that is agitated by the people who clearly show it. I know Im young, Im under no delusions that Im fully mature and that this is it, but I cant shake this feeling that Ill NEVER shake this. I have goals and dreams that I am actively sabotaging, and I need to stop. Its a lot to ask, I know, but could anyone offer some advice, or words of encouragement? Right now the idea that Ill fix myself up just seems completely alien to me.","Ive had some rough years before, or so I thought. 2018 has been a horrible year for my mental health.

"So...Today I was planning on giving myself a pizza birthday with anyone who wanted to join on my campus. I only have two friends. I got a check for $100 yesterday that I cashed and I have been looking forward to this all week. Even after my birthday that happened this past Wednesday. I had some bills to pay like hulu and neflix which I didn't mind. But i made sure that I was saving enough to I could buy the stuff. I got on the bus. Got some drinks for myself and I got two bracelets from hot topic too but what I didn't realize was that most of my billing stuff happened today. So I went from $60 to $8 cause I didn't know my netflix bill and hulu bill happened today. So after I bought drinks and two cool bracelets for myself, I didn't have enough money to buy my pizzas. I was at target and I had put two digornio's stuffed cheese pizzas in my cart and I was trying to check my bank finances cause I always get paranoid that money is going to disappear. But I had $40 after I bought my bracelets.","So...Today I was planning on giving myself a pizza birthday with anyone who wanted to join on my campus. I only have two friends.

Im tired, I feel weak, Im scared, and I feel alone even though I know Im not. I dont know why I feel this way.

"Im a freshman in college and recently I moved about an hour away from home to attend school. The past few months have been absolutely dreadful, from moving in to an apartment to being late on rent every single month. My parents are separated so theyre always fighting over who should help me when money gets tight. Ive ran through about 3 jobs at my new location and cant seem to find the best job to keep me steady. I turn 20 literally on Friday and the fact that Im 20 with no stable income and barely getting by is killing my motivation and the way I want to handle things in life. I just feel like I have nothing going for me anymore. The only thing I can say Im motivated about is starting up my own kicking camp to teach high school football kickers the most important techniques and tips for training and in game situations. Besides that I cant find something to hold on to that would keep my head high and keep my motivation running. I just feel lost and empty and I wish I could ask for help but I know Ive already asked too many times.

"Lately I've been feeling really shitty. I'm a senior in high school, and I'm on my way to being valedictorian, which is great, but I feel under a lot of pressure to win a ton of scholarships and get into some fantastic school. I have practically no support, as my friends just assume that I'm some genius, rather than a hard worker, and I would feel strange complaining about good grades. I recently broke up with my girlfriend of a year and a half, and I've been so active that I feel like I haven't had any time to get my mind straight. She was one of the few people I really connected with, and I had been planning my whole future around the idea of us being together, so now I'm chugging along with no clear destination. I'm having an extremely difficult time coming to terms with the idea that she isn't the one.Throughout asking for help introspective and reflective application essays, I've realized that my parents barely know me. In their attempts to help me with my break-up, they default to useless lessons in Christianity, which I ignore because I am not a Christian. However, my parents don't know this. I've refrained from telling them out of fear of being disowned. My reluctance to reveal this has led to me being the worship leader for my school's Christian organization (along with the fact that I'm the only person in my school who can sing and play guitar). My ex-girlfriend is the only person who knows I'm not Christian. I plan to tell my parents when I get to college, and don't have to live under their roof anymore.I'm hoping that college will be a new start for me, where I can actually be honest and connect with other people, but for the next few months, I'm alone and stressed. I could really use some kind words/good advice, r/encouragement.TL;DRStressed by senior year, emotional over break-up, lying about Christianity. Help?","Lately I've been feeling really shitty.

"I've got my recipes and all my ingredients, but my brain (Which is very good at self-sabotage) has come up with an outcome I'm having trouble dealing with. Putting aside the anxiety I'm feeling about just giving them to her, I'm utterly *terrified* she's going to think this is some kind of assholish passive-aggressive one-upmanship because I'm making the cannoli rather than buying it like she did with the cheesecake. I could just buy the cannoli and cut all this out, but tracking down the recipes and making them has and will help with the anxiety about giving them to her. I also feel the situation calls for the extra effort. I'll most likely say this when I give them to her, but that doesn't make the thought go away or the whole thing any less daunting.So have at me r/encouragement. Advice, encouragement, wisdom, please send word.","I've got my recipes and all my ingredients, but my brain (Which is very good at self-sabotage) has come up with an outcome I'm having trouble dealing with.

"So I need help, I've been through quite a lot lately. Going to NC with my controlling family, and from that I was depressed for months and my wonderful bf was there for me and encouraging. Ive been struggling with positivity and it's like my brain just doesn't know how to change a sentence to not be demeaning. Is there a good book on encouraging because I want to have his back and he shouldn't have to give everything to lift me up, I just wish I was better at lifting him up. A small example that we had a fight over. He got a gym membership and I'm allowed to be his guest, it was great until he got tired of going and I was encouraging enough to get him there. He wishes I just told him when we would go because I can't get in without him. He was mad at me because he said that he got us to the gym and I didn't do anything to keep us there. But he also hates this gym and works alot so it's not like I want to force him, I want him to be on board. This is mostly rambling but anything that anyone can do would be most grateful. I love him so much and he deserves better support.","So I need help, I've been through quite a lot lately.

"Using reddit is really nice, it helps me realize that Im not alone in the world. That others have problems just like me, often times worse. This year has been such a rollercoaster ride of hurt feelings, destroyed dreams, and missed opportunities. I found out this year that Im bi. And now Im in a relationship with another guy. My family (heavily Baptist) havent found out and I dont plan on telling them for as long as possible. Same story for my bf only worse. I worry for him, what if they find out? What if it ends? The US is now a flawed democracy and the only thing we have to look forward to is a ffffffucking civil war. My minds full of doubt all the time telling me that I wont be good enough. After all, whats the use in getting an education if people wont listen to the educated? I guess this is just me venting. I know others have issues bigger than me/mine. And I know that doesnt mean my problems dont mean something. Pain is relative to the person experiencing it. Honestly Im ready for the year to end. For new opportunities to come. And the chance for a better life in the future. I have a journal that I put my rants in but I just felt like putting this on reddit for whatever reason.

"Ive been on a downward spiralMy fianc and I have moved in together at the start of 2020, which either highlighted or exposed some major dependency issues that she has. On top of that, her mental health has been beyond terrible for herwhich is likely a huge driving force for the dependencyand Ive gotten Caregivers Fatigue 3 or 4 times already. I desperately want to communicate this issue but she can already read it off of me (been together for a long time) which is making her mental health worse at times, and I think if we were to outright have that conversation it would cause her mental health to be even worse. She also gets upset that it seems like I view her as helpless and unable to function without me, and admittedly I do because shes so extremely needyI hate myself physically. Literally from my head to my toes: I cant find a good haircut and the barber that I helped out with that couldnt be consistent, then COVID hit and Im out a barber & reference point for my hair. Im in too low of a funk to consistently care about maintaining my beard which is as frustrating as daily care would be. Ive been gaining fat all of 2020 which not only do I want to lose weight but Im also a nutrition major so thats not a good look.","Ive been on a downward spiralMy fianc and I have moved in together at the start of 2020, which either highlighted or exposed some major dependency issues that she has.

"What a weird couple of years.I will preface this saying that I am agnostic, so likely not to think too hard about religious comments; this isn't out of disrespect, though, so I ask that you respect that. But where to start?The fact I had to file bankruptcy a year ago?A fresh divorce because my wife didn't know what to do with herself; so I encouraged her to, at least, go to college and start fresh?The fact all of my teeth got removed at the end of 2020 due to poor inherited genes?Or maybe the current, crushing and bitter loneliness I know I need to overcome. Most of my friends evacuated the scene when I got married, partly my own fault for being an introvert that enjoys company, and going out, but rarely seeks it out. I also put my priorities into working, paying the bills, and focusing on the woman I loved, and trying to help her grow.That divorce wasn't bitter, as I do love her deeply - but whether or not there's a relationship of any kind going forward is a bit of a wildcard. In the end it was something we both decided would be good for her so that she could get real-life experience, and an education, so she could develop her own career and stand on her own two feet. I respect her, so she deserves that opportunity. But due to the bankruptcy I wouldn't have been able to put her through college myself.","What a weird couple of years.I will preface this saying that I am agnostic, so likely not to think too hard about religious comments; this isn't out of disrespect, though, so I ask that you respect that.

I want to go into the film industry with the goal of being a screenwriter/director or possibly even an editor. Honestly I'm open to anything within the film industry if I enjoy it. I know it's a super hard field to go into but its the only thing that I have ever been passionate about in my life. I graduate from college in less than two years and have no clue what to do after. I'm thinking about moving to California but it scares me. I know that I have a big chance of failure but I also know that if I don't pursue this career that I will regret it for the rest of my life and will always think about the what if. I guess I'm just looking for somebody to say it'll be alright and don't give up. Thanks!,I want to go into the film industry with the goal of being a screenwriter/director or possibly even an editor.

"Looks like the depression and disappointment hit me post midnight, as Im currently up at 5 am typing this. You know when only *one* small thing goes wrong then suddenly youre all up in a rut about every life decision youve made? Well, Im feeling really shitty about the fact that technically I allowed two things of my own possession to get slightly damaged, all in one night. Due to being lazy in bed, I asked my dad to shake my lava lamp to let the floating hardened liquid to sink towards the bottom. He shook it too hard, causing the whole thing to fall apart and for the lightbulb to lose one of its connector pieces. He said hed go to the hardware store soon to replace the lightbulb, but Im in slight doubt if the lamp will work after that, feeling that its my fault, in technical aspects. This is going to also sound ridiculous, but my new phone (no case, no screen protector) somehow slid off the surface I placed it on while doing something this late at night, causing it to hit the hard floor screen first, getting itself some small scratches on its corners in the process. I know the scratches arent that bad, but my obsessive compulsive disorder really tests my tolerance when it comes to the smallest things. And it was a new phone that Ive only had for a couple of weeks, for crying out loud! Ive just been self deprecating for the past two hours, so far.In sum from all of this, how do I effectively diminish the thought of I could have done this to prevent this or that so I can learn from these small situations that have been bothering me for the past couple of hours? I guess I somehow have a compass as to how I can solve this, but hearing something from somebody else would really encourage me.","Looks like the depression and disappointment hit me post midnight, as Im currently up at 5 am typing this.

"After reviewing my transcript, I needed to take Nutrition, Anatomy and Physiology and microbiology. I registered this semester to take all of them. They dont start till October 14th but most programs let you still apply to them so long as the classes are completed by the time the program starts. So I still have time. UAB has a competitive program but the deadline for the spring has passed and I wouldnt start till the Fall of 2021. Its still in option but I wanted to start as fast as possible. So looking into programs that start in spring 2021, most of them were ADN programs but I knew if I wanted to advance my career in nursing, I would need at least the minimum of a BSN. Often times when I decided I would do an ADN at a smaller university I would fill out the applications only to find out I would need more classes because a lot of my classes wouldnt transfer from UAB which helped in my GPA aspect but meaning more time before I could actually sit in a nursing program. That being said with a miracle of luck, I found this joint program with a community college that actually partners with UAB to allow you to get your ADN and BSN at the same time.","After reviewing my transcript, I needed to take Nutrition, Anatomy and Physiology and microbiology.

"If you take the time to read this, thank you.If you arent sure what to say afterwards, thats ok.If you are going to reply with the intent to help me, please exclude any exclamation points. I realize that this might seem insignificant, but I cant handle any more exclamation points. Especially if its located at the end of a platitude. Everything is going to be fine? CONVINCE ME.I am 31, male. Diagnosed bipolar mixed state. When Im manic, I often get fixated on ideas/concepts. In my most recent episode, I came up with an idea for a patent. Although my mania has subsided, Im still convinced that my idea is worthwhile, so Im not going to reveal the specifics. Sorry.I was so overwhelmed with excitement, that I went to my friends apartment to share the idea with them. I tend to have a very small circle of friends these two in particular are a couple that I had spent nearly half my days with for the past couple years. I felt a deep bond between us.They read my proposal, and their reaction was basically holy shit.","If you take the time to read this, thank you.If you arent sure what to say afterwards, thats ok.If you are going to reply with the intent to help me, please exclude any exclamation points.

"Hello reddit strangers, I could use some encouragement this morning. I am fighting my demons and they are winning. I cant go to the hospital I would lose everything and truly have nothing to live for. Life without reason is no life, so if you say go to the hospital, I will put that in the just kill yourself category. I am in pain, such pain right now I am having trouble seeing that it will ever end.I met a girl before the crap happened, and we went out every week a few times each week for many months. There was a instant chemistry, it was like we had known each other for years. We laughed at the same jokes, we liked the same music, we were both sensual creatures with each other. We had such a great time together, laughing, making out, and just holding each other.We talked about the future, what we wanted to do together, places to visit, things to do, how our live would be together. We talked about getting a house together and cooking dinner and watching movies and playing with her daughter, we created a life that we both wanted.","Hello reddit strangers, I could use some encouragement this morning.

"Its 5 semesters long and I meet the requirements to apply and submitted my application to start in the spring. Currently Im in the process of getting transcripts over and having them be evaluated to see what classes transferred over. Sent them this week. Ive been in touch with the program director and shes working with me after I told her my past history with everything now its just a matter of waiting on the transcripts. If I need extra classes I can take them potentially before the program starts. So hope all things go well for me. But its all dependent on what transfer from UAB to them. However I know its a long shot, but I rather find out now and see what I can do or I can always start this program in the fall as well. This is where Im at today.","Its 5 semesters long and I meet the requirements to apply and submitted my application to start in the spring.
