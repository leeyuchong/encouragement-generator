First of dont worry you will make it. landscaping is a rather demanding business and i suspect a seasonal one. an i wish i could see your floral arrangements i love pictures of flowers. if your in a city then getting work is only a matter of time as long as you are determined.,"I have tons of experience from landscaping making planters for all seasons. I also understand variety, textures, colours etc I am just bogged down by no one giving me a chance. I built a bouquet at an interview and she said she was so impressed, and despite telling me she'd call back, she just ghosted me. I know we are a couple, but I hate using his money for things I want/ need. I have been working since I was 14 (picking fruit on farms during the summer for 2 years) and on my own since 19 (I'm 32). I really hate relying on people and as this point I'm forced to because all my savings are gone. I come from a poorer family and they don't have money to share. I was so excited for the move because I honestly thought I had a great resume, and an awesome portfolio (for landscape design). I have reached out to the design companies in my area and never recieved a courtesy email back."

My living situation is really weird right now. Three days/nights a week, I live in a small city for my master's program. During that time,  I live in a house with this random older woman (she's nice, but still random) and a roommate. It's comfortable enough, but def not my home and I always feel like a stranger/guest. The other three nights a week, I live with my fiance four hours north in an apartment that we don't love in a town we both hate (it's super rural, we miss our families & friends in another state, etc). So, half the week I'm at school in a weird living situation, and the other half I'm with my fiance in a weird living situation."

Instead, he flew into a rage and started to berate me saying that I was keeping his son away from him and I was like every other bitch that tries to hold fathers back from their kids"" I tell him I'm not keeping the baby away from you- I just want to go home. All of a sudden, he is choking me very aggressively. I defended myself by slapping, kicking and scratching him to get off me. He puts me in full nelson and slams me on the couch. I fall on the floor and the altercation is still occurring and I'm still defending myself by kicking and hitting him in the leg."

It's possible to get a brief perverse pleasure out if pulling others down. But what people don't realize is that comes back to hurt you.

Of note I'm married with a 6 moth old daughter.Well...I showed up to my first calculus test (I originally passed it with an 89.6 in 2002 but am retaking it to prepare for calculus II) and the teacher told us we couldn't use our calculators and to put them away.

I felt humiliated and alone. I feel like I can't go there anymore to ask questions, and without that, I'm lost. I do not have the capacity to read thousands and thousands of pages of documentation and policy and study them and learn then by heart. I'm lost.

Lately, I don't want to be here anymore. I don't necessarily want to kill myself persay just not exist. I'm feeling like a complete failure and that the world would be better off if I wasn't in it. I'm not remarkable. I'm not going to change the world (although that's what I thought I was suppose to do). At best I will live an average normal existence. I hate that in order to even remotely be alright I have to take medication for the rest of my life. Anxiety and depression overwhelm my life.

I felt I grew into my looks and I trusted my family would still help me with the surgeries because only then, maybe I could seek their approval for my dreams.There were many times I would say my dreams aloud and people would tell me they wouldnt happen. They claimed Im average looking and nothing special. It didnt make sense to me. How could people openly be so rude? I would go home and stare at myself... re-counting the trauma of bullies and also, the remarks of my family claiming that surgery would make me a goddess.Heres the thing: I told my family again age 18 I was saving my money for LA and I planned to set out to model and act. The whole table let out a huge roar as if Bernie Mac made the best joke ever... so much laughter, pointing their fingers, laughing with unchewed food in their mouth. You an actress?

I'm normally not like this, there are \*very\* few things I feel self-conscious about but for some reason getting into this art as an adult, I feel a weird anxiousness about it.I did a few tricks in high school, studied as an actor in college (didn't go anywhere but I liked the experience) and generally the most animated in a group of friends, I think I'm pretty natural as an entertainer. I do not understand why I suddenly care so much about what people are gonna think to see a 26 year old doing beginner tricks. Especially since my friends are such good supporters, they wouldn't make fun of me even if I super flubbed a trick.I understand confidence is a big factor in magic, in any performance art so I'd love to hear some inspiring words to help me shake off this apprehension.Thank you all ahead of time!"

However, ever since then it feels like there is a rift in the friendship that I had zero intention of creating, you see, I never fully wanted to get into a relationship as she had just started her freshman year of college and I am in my Junior year of highschool(we're only a year apart in age) so we were both stressed with school."

I desperately want to communicate this issue but she can already read it off of me (been together for a long time) which is making her mental health worse at times, and I think if we were to outright have that conversation it would cause her mental health to be even worse.

","I've taken on a 3-year university course that is said to be really tough, but it's something I'm truly interested in. The thing about this university is that there is no project work, no presentation or participation points to help my grade- EVERYTHING is based on the results of a year-end exam. Last year, I failed ALL my modules and had to resit them, which makes me one year behind. This year, I managed to clear two of my toughest modules, but I failed the other two, which means that I now will take 5 years to graduate.My parents and friends are telling me not to beat myself up over it, but I can't help but feel so, so disappointed that I did not pass everything. I had such expectations for myself too.I guess I really feel insecure about graduating a lot later than everyone else I know. I feel really depressed that I can't do well in something that I like."

She's nice, funny, quiet, shy, cute, and from the little bit we've interacted she seems like an interesting person. We haven't interacted much outside of passing conversation because I'm also a pretty quiet and shy person, so the few times I've had the chance I've never been able to think of a way to interact with her without it seeming very forced or making it awkward for one or both of us.

Often times when I decided I would do an ADN at a smaller university I would fill out the applications only to find out I would need more classes because a lot of my classes wouldnt transfer from UAB which helped in my GPA aspect but meaning more time before I could actually sit in a nursing program. That being said with a miracle of luck, I found this joint program with a community college that actually partners with UAB to allow you to get your ADN and BSN at the same time. Its 5 semesters long and I meet the requirements to apply and submitted my application to start in the spring."

It felt like every little thing I did, rubbed everyone the wrong way. No matter if I did one thing right, three four, sometimes six things would go wrong. Whether that be with school, friends, parents, or any other things. I got involved with the wrong crowd, not like drugs or anything like that but typical college things like partying and drinking.

It felt like every little thing I did, rubbed everyone the wrong way. No matter if I did one thing right, three four, sometimes six things would go wrong.

I will walk before the Lord in the land of the living.Psalms 116:8-9 KJVThe psalmist often had to listen to the echo of their own prayers as they cried out to God from a place of isolation. Even if others are around, we can feel lonely if we forget that God is always there. We don't know who wrote Psalm 116, or in what circumstances, but the situation was dire (Seems hopeless). In verse Three he said the pain of death surrounded him and he found trouble and sorrow. During his isolation and fear, he called out to God, and beg God to deliver his soul (verse 4). But in verse 5 we find Gracious is the LORD, and righteous and merciful.No trouble is greater than God's power. Loneliness is a fiction since God is always with us. Call upon Him today and He will hear you, and draw near to you. Have a blessed day.   :)"

Its redirection. Not rejection. Head up my friend. A new year is coming and it brings fourth new friends and a new love for you.((Hugs)),The subject of our relationship status got brought up again and she said she was conflicted and part of her wants to just remain friends and part of her wants something more. I asked her if we could talk about it in person but we had to end up FaceTiming. It turns out all that flirting and leading on was her intentionally doing that to see if she was interested. What I took as affection turned out to be experimentation and at this point she was trying to avoid telling me the truth. Ive been rejected before but this one was different. She was leading me on for a month and a half and I thought I was really getting somewhere. The fact that she tried to feel that way for me and couldnt made everything worse. I know this may sound irrational but I cant help feel that there is something wrong with me and that Im screwed up and thats why this happened to me.

It just makes it sound like I have to hurry everything in my lifestyle and can't take it slow, what a way to do things fast and bad. You can't hurry art!I'd say it's not completely baseless, as there seems to be experiments on rejuvenation already, and I'm in my middle 20s.

Imagine going home and telling your family you had big dreams and just like the school kids, they tell you youre not good looking. I recall drawing my face and writing, nose job, mole removal, lip injections, hair needs to be blonde. I presented this to a few adults in my family because they were the ones who told me when I was 8 I needed lip injections, nose job and blonde hair. Some were horrified. Some were agreeing that when I was of age we can start making me beautiful."

I feel like a failure for not finishing my degree the first time, and for getting myself into this whole mess by wasting money like crazy that last year at my previous institution among other things. I'm mad at myself for letting myself fall down like this. I'm mad at myself for not learning the first time that I need to be more proactive on things. Gah.Sorry for the feeling vomit. If you made it through all that, congrats, and here's a towel to wipe off the feeling vomit."
Touch. I'm definately one who is prone to being overwhelmed.,"So on top of being perfect we have things like global warming, the entire world that needs to be fixed to worry about too. So let me just say this...Slow down. You will not be perfect. You will not live those glamorous lives you think are real. Just stop striving for perfect and start striving for your best, you will never fall short. Work hard, love hard, and take care of yourself. Stop hating yourself. Stop hating others. If you know that today you tried your best than you did a good job! Sometimes we will have bad days. Sometimes everything will go wrong."

,"Looks like the depression and disappointment hit me post midnight, as Im currently up at 5 am typing this. You know when only *one* small thing goes wrong then suddenly youre all up in a rut about every life decision youve made? Well, Im feeling really shitty about the fact that technically I allowed two things of my own possession to get slightly damaged, all in one night. Due to being lazy in bed, I asked my dad to shake my lava lamp to let the floating hardened liquid to sink towards the bottom. He shook it too hard, causing the whole thing to fall apart and for the lightbulb to lose one of its connector pieces. He said hed go to the hardware store soon to replace the lightbulb, but Im in slight doubt if the lamp will work after that, feeling that its my fault, in technical aspects. If I had simply gotten up to do it myself, then my lamp would have been fine."

He's telling me I'm trash, that's why I don't have a ring on my finger, all of my relationships in the future will result in men passing me around because I'm a grimy person. I fall for this trap and lose my shit and get into a verbal altercation with him.

It's comfortable enough, but def not my home and I always feel like a stranger/guest. The other three nights a week, I live with my fiance four hours north in an apartment that we don't love in a town we both hate (it's super rural, we miss our families & friends in another state, etc). So, half the week I'm at school in a weird living situation, and the other half I'm with my fiance in a weird living situation."

I really hate relying on people and as this point I'm forced to because all my savings are gone. I come from a poorer family and they don't have money to share.

"Can you share your channel? Id love to give it a listen.As for encouragement, think of it this way. There are probably people who could really use your kind of talent.

Just as your focus has shifted towards Christ so has my focus as well and it started somewhere in 2018 while I was attending medical school and had a part time job. Although in the midst of school I had asked him what about school?,"Its not a good place to be in when everything you trust in is fading away.

He shook it too hard, causing the whole thing to fall apart and for the lightbulb to lose one of its connector pieces. He said hed go to the hardware store soon to replace the lightbulb, but Im in slight doubt if the lamp will work after that, feeling that its my fault, in technical aspects. If I had simply gotten up to do it myself, then my lamp would have been fine."

Thanks for posting this. This helped me,"A big question I think a lot of people are asking these days is why are we so depressed, why are we so anxious.

Every single thing we do we are pressured with the fact that we arent good enough. We arent doing it right. We arent doing it perfectly. We live in an illusion that some people are but its all just a magic trick. People put on a fake face. No one truly knows whats real anymore, so we sit there thinking we arent good enough, we arent as good as everyone else. We have access to all the bad news around the world like never  before."

Looking for Encouragement.Just as the title says, I once had the dream of being in medical school, but due to my low gpa, changed my focus to nursing and I was looking for encouragement.

UAB was impressed by this and offered me a scholarship. Fast forward, I graduated high school with a GPA of a 4.42."

Just as your focus has shifted towards Christ so has my focus as well and it started somewhere in 2018 while I was attending medical school and had a part time job. Although in the midst of school I had asked him what about school?,"And I found the answer in a verse from bible, Romans 8:28~ and we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose The responsibility I have is to shift my identity and put it in God, because God is permanent. When I put my identity , of who I am in something permanent thats when there is no fear of losing peace, thats when I have nothing to be anxious of. Doesnt it answer our fundamental question. We lose so much of our lives in giving and focusing on temporary needs and dont realise the grave danger of losing out on hope. I found the answer in this Covid 19 situation and somehow Im grateful that I realised it. Im regaining my peace during the madness around me and I want to leave you with this exhortation to shift your identity to Jesus. Because all it took was a pandemic to shift mine in something permanent.."

I was put into a special class but it was for kids with ADHD which was what I was misdiagnosed with which I didn't have. Well, I never did well in school because I didn't get the help I needed.

I dont know what happened, but Ive developed a seemingly unshakable hatred for my physical appearance, constantly nitpicking and tearing apart everything about myself. I recently had to decide to take a few steps away from alcohol, for a time, because Ive developed a tendency to use it as an escape from confronting any real issues I have, emotionally. Im staying up until 5 AM, Sleeping in until 3 PM, and staying inside with little to no motivation to do anything but shut myself away in my room and wait until I can sleep again.Theres something in me that refuses to believe my friends want to stay close, and something worse still that is agitated by the people who clearly show it."

Just today I was at the gym not 10 minutes ago and a couple of super skinny super hot girls just snickered at me. Part of it's probably because I'm paranoid but I feel like they were saying look at the fat girl trying to be like us Jesus Christ she doesn't f****** belong here. And so I ran home.

"I'm cheering for you, and I am inspired by your ability to self reflect and move forward with a plan that you believe is right for you, regardless of the opinions of those who don't believe in you.",":Around July I applied to a masters in biomedical sciences at NOVA. This was a specialized program in Florida aimed to help student with below standards to boost their application into medical school or dental school. You needed a minimum of a 2.5 gpa to apply and this was my last chance to get into medical school as if you got in and completed the program you were able to receive an interview to their medical school. Which in my eyes was a good thing because a lot of people apply and most dont get interviews. Well if I could cut the curve and gone to interviews then I beat more than the people and had a higher chance. However I ultimately didnt get accepted. So I decided it was time to not necessarily stop my dreams of medical school, but rather but it on pause and do something else for a bit and if the cards play out, reapply to medical school later down the road. Focusing and narrowing down to what I liked to do best, I found myself pursuing nursing."

I have a bachelor of science in graphic design, but it's a popular career and I'm just not competitive enough. When my old job falsely accused me of assault, I got a certificate in technical writing to boost my chances at a new job. When I learned I might need to somehow move into a senior community to help out a friend, I got a certificate for in-home senior care so I could be his caretaker. Due to the pandemic, many certification classes are extremely cheap. So I picked up a photoshop class to boost my chances of a side job with graphic design even though the degree should technically cover it.Now I seem to have an ""addiction"" to getting more education and certificates.

My current situation is unsustainable, and these early classes will allow me to stick with my usual evening shift; but I have a long history of being easily discouraged and can already feel myself backpedaling.

If it ruins a friendship then it ruins a friendship but often people will respect you more when you set a boundary. You got this!!!!,The subject of our relationship status got brought up again and she said she was conflicted and part of her wants to just remain friends and part of her wants something more. I asked her if we could talk about it in person but we had to end up FaceTiming. It turns out all that flirting and leading on was her intentionally doing that to see if she was interested. What I took as affection turned out to be experimentation and at this point she was trying to avoid telling me the truth. Ive been rejected before but this one was different. She was leading me on for a month and a half and I thought I was really getting somewhere. The fact that she tried to feel that way for me and couldnt made everything worse. I know this may sound irrational but I cant help feel that there is something wrong with me and that Im screwed up and thats why this happened to me. Every time I put myself out there I get hurt and this one was a huge blow to the gut.

I attend college but honestly have no real clue what I wanna do with my life, I have a very strong interest in mathematics though and would love to help advance technology. Last semester I got straight As but sacrificed my social life for it, and now even when I try to make friends at school, nobody shares similar interests to myself or cares to pay any attention to me. Everyone else just cares about stuff I don't care about like drugs or video games, I want to get out and explore new things. I love action sports but I have lost interest recently due to both my depression and lack of friends to bike and skate with."

Oh and not being able to see 2 of my friends wasn't enough I got pulled into the counselors office and told that I will be repeating earth science and that I will be taking a course over the summer."
Congrats thats badass but you have an ex-wife at 22??,"I'm looking forward to moving out from my parents' house and in with my girlfriend into our own place in the coming months hopefully.

Im right there with you on these fears. Biohacking can only do so much as the science seems to be in its infancy.,"I'm actually relatively young (26) , and I'm an artist. But for months I've been more and more fearful of the concept of retirement due to ageing, and ageing in general, I guess. The idea that unless rejuvenation sciencie gets as far as expected, my body will start giving in against my will and I will be forced to stop doing what I like.Is it possible to be efficiently active and old? Or do I reach a point in which I peak and then, no matter my discipline, I am condemned to go lower and lower, never doing as good again? Isn't there something I CAN do? Can it be a matter of attitude?  I already am super productive to counter, but it's not helping that much with the fear.Maybe this is the reason why I'm a big futurist and transhumanist, but I'd like to believe I'm not just delusionally grasping a burning nail and have reasons... But I digress."
"Moved out and lived with roommates, stressed about home, little money (thankfully my boyfriend lived near by so he helped some), one roommate was depressed and was more suicidal after an accident, the other ended up moving back home and didn't tell either of us (we just came home and she was gone)...","Im a freshman in college and recently I moved about an hour away from home to attend school.

My parents are separated so theyre always fighting over who should help me when money gets tight. Ive ran through about 3 jobs at my new location and cant seem to find the best job to keep me steady. I turn 20 literally on Friday and the fact that Im 20 with no stable income and barely getting by is killing my motivation and the way I want to handle things in life."
"Adonai's finger chafing inward soul, and we see the work budding growth, illuminating [observable] disposition.","I've taken on a 3-year university course that is said to be really tough, but it's something I'm truly interested in. The thing about this university is that there is no project work, no presentation or participation points to help my grade- EVERYTHING is based on the results of a year-end exam. Last year, I failed ALL my modules and had to resit them, which makes me one year behind. This year, I managed to clear two of my toughest modules, but I failed the other two, which means that I now will take 5 years to graduate.My parents and friends are telling me not to beat myself up over it, but I can't help but feel so, so disappointed that I did not pass everything. I had such expectations for myself too.I guess I really feel insecure about graduating a lot later than everyone else I know. I feel really depressed that I can't do well in something that I like."
"I know it may not seem like it, but you do have an impact on the world. By existing, you are affecting whats happening in the world, even if it is just in your small community.","I need some help. I'm having a lot of trouble mentally and don't want to burden friends and family with my issues. I don't want to burden anyone really. But I guess strangers are better in this scenario. Lately, I don't want to be here anymore. I don't necessarily want to kill myself persay just not exist. I'm feeling like a complete failure and that the world would be better off if I wasn't in it. I'm not remarkable. I'm not going to change the world (although that's what I thought I was suppose to do). At best I will live an average normal existence. I hate that in order to even remotely be alright I have to take medication for the rest of my life. Anxiety and depression overwhelm my life.

Anyone else feeling burnt out by all the check in phone calls, Skypes, Zooms, and texts? I am a fairly strong introvert by nature. I require downtime to charge my batteries. I am also a nurse, and I'm working 9-10 hours a day (not much for a nurse I know when I see the 12-14 hour/day shifts my colleagues are working.)By day, I take care of  sick, nervous, scared, concerned people and their families. The place where I work restricted visitors, so now in addition to caring for the patient, I'm also on the phone with their family updating on conditions and also providing emotional support."
First thing I do in situations like that is trying to look at it at the current perspective - the current state of lamp is broken. I can only do something to change this state now but what was in the past stays in the past.,"Looks like the depression and disappointment hit me post midnight, as Im currently up at 5 am typing this. You know when only *one* small thing goes wrong then suddenly youre all up in a rut about every life decision youve made? Well, Im feeling really shitty about the fact that technically I allowed two things of my own possession to get slightly damaged, all in one night. Due to being lazy in bed, I asked my dad to shake my lava lamp to let the floating hardened liquid to sink towards the bottom. He shook it too hard, causing the whole thing to fall apart and for the lightbulb to lose one of its connector pieces. He said hed go to the hardware store soon to replace the lightbulb, but Im in slight doubt if the lamp will work after that, feeling that its my fault, in technical aspects."

"It cuts you down when people sneer, smirk, joke, bully, make fun of, etc... at you and it is hurtful. Yes, completely!

Just today I was at the gym not 10 minutes ago and a couple of super skinny super hot girls just snickered at me. Part of it's probably because I'm paranoid but I feel like they were saying look at the fat girl trying to be like us Jesus Christ she doesn't f****** belong here. And so I ran home. I don't know if I can keep going to the gym and having those negative experiences. I'm just to anxiety-ridden and depressed to not go to the gym but at the same time when it's making those symptoms worse... I don't know I just need some encouragement."
"Ok I want to recommend some things: Try taking care of your body. Go eat some food, drink water, take a shower, take your meds. It's important.

I trusted her promise to me. I have had only heartache for many years while trying to find someone to be with. I get hurt each time I let my heart believe. This time its different, I truly love her like no other before and I want to be with her, to help support her to help he with the stress of life, to be her partner in life.

I'm following this account on IG called @cuppacourage that features encouraging statements. Maybe this can help both of you somehow? Hope everything works out. ,"Many thanks.Could you please PM me if you're interested in doing this huge kindness?Edited: I noticed that earlier someone left a comment saying I should ditch him (somehow the comment disappeared). I shouldn't ask for people's random kindness to send him postcards and letters with encouraging words. I'm now taking steps to rebuild my life despite the fact that I'm also affected by him though we've been in two different countries since November last year. This is something I also need to learn for the sake of being a human who very likely would experience a variety of hardships, especially your own life difficulties, family's hard times, and significant one's/ones' hard times. I really don't need to hear any harsh things as I've been hearing a lot.I know I should also take good care of myself as I have mental health issues, OCDs and weak physical health. However when I have a bit of energy to do something more I always try to do it."

It just makes it sound like I have to hurry everything in my lifestyle and can't take it slow, what a way to do things fast and bad. You can't hurry art!I'd say it's not completely baseless, as there seems to be experiments on rejuvenation already, and I'm in my middle 20s. Of course it does not mean I'm going to live my life carelessly or let it pass me. I already am pretty active to do my best and achieve everything I want to achieve.

I understand how you feel. As Im actually about to leave for an event to try to do that same thing. Connect on some level with people. Mostly because my therapist told me thats what i needed to do. But every fiber of my being screams make up a reason not to go! But Ill go and Maybe enjoy it. Knowing that someone else has the same struggles helps. Take care of yourself!,I guess I just have to do that for myself. I think I need to force myself to go out and talk to other people and do things to bring me in to connection with the world. I just feel like hiding under a blanket for the rest of my life. I of course can't do that. Wish I could be different as I constantly don't like myself. Not really sure what I'm asking.

Make efforts to show your Mom that you are trying.,And on top of that my mom kicks me out of the house for 4 hours and I don't have a car so I get to bike in a rainstorm and when I'm finally allowed back in she tells me that I need to fuck off and stop being bad at school.

You sound like me! Which I guess means you arent alone. Something that has helped me (fellow perfectionist) is to see all the good things youve done as much as the bad things.

I know freelancing is hard like really really hard but its something that makes me happy (I currently have a part time job which is essentially what Ill be doing as a freelancer) and I know starting from the very beginning will be extremely hard but Im mentally prepared for it. Ive also saved enough money to live for a year which Im confident that Ill be able to get clients by then.

I learned that sharing my ideas, interests and hobbies will always been seen as weird. It's made me struggle with talking to new people and even made me fearful for thinking about making friends.

Honestly you have no obligation to finish any of the classes once you find something else that interests you so if you find something like work or a new hobby your in the free and clear.Many people use education to keep their minds fresh and sharp and honestly its rather admirable.,"As I said, most of these classesare on sale due to schools trying to help either people who were laid off find new skills or people who are in quarantine find new hobbies, and they are usually between $10 and $25 each depending on the class.I ended up picking up classes to get certified in copywriting, dog training, and digital photography on top of what I mentioned above. I'm starting to regret picking up these new skills- like it feels like I'm trying to compensate or fill a void now.Am I biting off more than I can chew here? Am I doing too much? Is there such a thing as too much learning? Should I stop? I could just use a little direction and confirmation that this choice to learn more will not end up disappointing me in the future."
Stay strong! I guarantee hes gonna regret all that when your gone. Just focus on your plan to move out,"Once again, my dad called me ""worthless,"" ""bitch,"" and ""asshole."" He's never used the word ""asshole"" on me before, so that's a new one. But anyway, I'm getting kind of sick and tired of him telling me this stuff. He always does it, and I'm starting to lose count of how many times he's verbally hurt me like this. You don't know how many times he's told me I won't have a future. After all, I'm out of the house in 4 years. He keeps reminding me of that like he doesn't want me anymore. I'm l just a Freshman, and I don't know what to do in life! It probably sounds ridiculous, I know."
"You are being incredibly kind by worrying about someone that has hurt you. If you're worried about his parents recognizing your voice, have a friend make the phone call and give them notes on what to say. Even calling the police at risk of him losing his scholarship is better than letting him die. If something does happen, don't blame yourself. You are already doing more than most people would do for an abusive ex.","But I'm so scared. I haven't spoken to his parents in years. If they recognize my voice and tell him, he'll talk about me behind my back, which will just push me closer to wanting to die myself. He might even contact me himself, which would be the most traumatizing thing I can think of. He might not even go through with it, I don't want to scare his parents without reason. I don't want them to think this was just a shitty, shitty prank. But better safe than sorry, right...?"
"I'm not a nutrition or health professional, but I'm fairly sure that diet and calories consumed is a more effective way of managing weight than exercise - but of course there are mental and physical health benefits with exercise.","I recently got married, then my wife and I decided to foster, then we moved. All within a year and a half. We both use to be so active almost every day. I understand parenting is a priority but with this current child we literally cannot get out of the house. It's just too hard. I use to ride/run up to 20 miles a week and my wife use to run 10ish and do yoga 4 times a week. Now she is lucky to do yoga twice a month and I might get 30 minutes each week to run or ride. I'm kinda depressed, anxious about getting fat and catch myself slipping on my healthy foods. Wife feels the same. Im honestly just thinking about accepting my fate, buying larger clothes and just letting go. I dont want it but that's what seems to be happening."
"Don't just quit bud! I think you have the passion and drive to become a personal trainer. It may be that a corporate gym might not be the best setting to start off given that it's such a small clientele, and you wouldn't be getting as much experience. It's good to be at a bigger place where clients are being pooled by the trainers. You got this!!!","It was going... slow. Okay, I guess, but slow. Everyone says it takes about 6 months to get your feet under you, learn how to make sales, and really start making a livable paycheck.Well, here I am, month 7. My boss is riding my ass to get more consulations, he expects at least 3 new business sales and 4 client resigns from me this month. I need 3 new business units (someone who has never before bought training) and $2,500 total in personal training sales. It is now the 16th and I don't have a single NBU, let alone even $100 of training.And not just that, but I haven't had a single person show up for an appointment for two shifts in a row. Consultation OR client. And I'm trying to get a class off the ground, because allegedly its an easy way to hit new business goals, since it's significantly cheaper than individual personal training."
"Many things out of my control can make me deviate from where I thought I wanted to end up, but nothing can take my hard work away from me!Best of luck, and give yourself the benefit of the doubt!",Ive been out of school for 2 years now.

Sometimes I worry that I don't have what it takes to succeed and that even that even though in school I've made B's I'm worried my time away has made me less. What if I cant get B's anymore?

Your son will be a better person because of your love and dedication. Be well!&lt;3","I came back to the apartment a short time later and told him, ""I am not keeping your son away from you, but I think it's best that I go home with my because we are not getting a long at the moment."" I created space between the both of us, so he would not feel as if I was in his space or threatening him. Instead, he flew into a rage and started to berate me saying that I was keeping his son away from him and I was like every other bitch that tries to hold fathers back from their kids"" I tell him I'm not keeping the baby away from you- I just want to go home. All of a sudden, he is choking me very aggressively. I defended myself by slapping, kicking and scratching him to get off me. He puts me in full nelson and slams me on the couch. I fall on the floor and the altercation is still occurring and I'm still defending myself by kicking and hitting him in the leg."

While I don't know much about Calculus, I can tell you that one bad test grade is not going to make or break your class.","Well, I just got back my grade and it's a 37/100 and I'm panicking thinking this was all a mistake quitting my career to go back to school just to try and find a career I was actually passionate about. I'm enjoying learning but failing that bad has me in panic mode. I already struggle with depression and I'm hoping to benefit from talking with someone about it. I don't feel like I can talk to my wife about it.:("
"Hey friend. I hope you find what you want to do. In my experience, it takes a bit of self discovery and experimenting. Whatever you do end up doing though, I hope you find it satisfying.

Hope you find what you want to do.","It sums it up in the title and Ive talked to teachers, consolers, you name I have. I never get a straight answer and Im lost.

"Lastly, I'd definitely encourage you to continue to pursue someplace to go for your mental health. I assure you that there are those who care and want to help you, that's why they're there.","Returning to school after ~10 years feels weird. Its a struggle, in fact. I went in feeling confident, but... something is wrong. Scored 95% and 92% on the first two exams of my most challenging class, but basically flunked everything else in my other classes.Part of me just... died. I feel like I peeked behind the curtain and cant return to reality in the same way. I can barely take care of myself. I dont *want* to take care of myself. And its not as if a dark half of myself is whispering these things, trying to take over. I feel as though all of me is ready to die.Since I left my job, no more quality health insurance. I only have access to basic services."
"Sometimes just getting help for and taking care of yourself can go a long ways. Even if you're just in a funk, it can help.","Ive been on a downward spiralMy fianc and I have moved in together at the start of 2020, which either highlighted or exposed some major dependency issues that she has. On top of that, her mental health has been beyond terrible for herwhich is likely a huge driving force for the dependencyand Ive gotten Caregivers Fatigue 3 or 4 times already. I desperately want to communicate this issue but she can already read it off of me (been together for a long time) which is making her mental health worse at times, and I think if we were to outright have that conversation it would cause her mental health to be even worse. She also gets upset that it seems like I view her as helpless and unable to function without me, and admittedly I do because shes so extremely needyI hate myself physically. Literally from my head to my toes: I cant find a good haircut and the barber that I helped out with that couldnt be consistent, then COVID hit and Im out a barber & reference point for my hair."
"That's rough. It will get better, honestly. Maybe do something for you today (not stimulus related). Get ice cream, go on a walk and get some sun, etc. Take a day where you just take a deep breath... take a nap, eat decent, etc.","it got to the point where I was terrified to go into work and all they told me was to just leave him alone. so I quit. every time something good happens 10 bad things happen. I wrecked my car and I have a rental car now, but whatever money the insurance gives me my dad is just gonna use to pay off the car that I wrecked. so getting a new car is on me and I have no money. no job. im getting really fucking tired of this shit. all my friends do drugs so I pretty much lost all of them when I got out of rehab. ive stayed clean for the most part, ive only drank and smoked weed a handful of times. i has a job interview today but I couldnt go because I didnt have enough gas in my car. i just want a fucking break."
I hope you find people who truly appreciate you and I hope they build you up and support you.Best wishes my friend. I hope you can find a way to resolve your situation.,"Literally, the only thing that is keeping me together at this point is the internet. People encourage others and make people laugh, even though you don't know them. Under all the craziness of school drama and life, I can still find some good online. Anyway, I just need some tips on how to get my dad's words out of my head, or at least a link to a funny meme to cheer me up or something. I just need to stop overthinking all the stuff he yells at me for. I'm not good at explaining stuff, so can you just throw some comments at me? It seems like I'm just asking for attention, and now that I think of it, I probably am. I don't get any in real life, so let's just see if some random people online care!:)  why did i write this"
"Life is rough and I know that sounds like an oversimplification but its true. However I want you to know that it is possible to live and experience this thing we call life and when you hear others say it gets better, it may help to think that they say this because they truly mean it. They believe in you and care about you. Id definitely recommend the resources top comment posted.","I have for quite a while now. Thats not really the truth though. I do feel something. Fear. Im afraid of losing those I care about. Im afraid that Im not good enough.

That makes me afraid of the person behind the mask I put on every day to face the world.I want someone to care. Anyone."
"Either way, drop a few hard hitting jokes and they'll either get the point, and no longer be comfortable with making those jokes... or they'll think it's hilarious and open the door to more inclusive jokes.","Hey. 22 year old guy, living in a small town in West Texas. Moved here for my first job outside of college. The job is good, and I have a good group of people out here. But I'm hiding from a lot of people that I'm gay. My closest friends know. My family knows. But the people I'm with day in and day out don't know. So in some ways I'm still in closest there, but what's hurting me the most is those who I'm out to. My friends will just keep making ""fag"" jokes. My family will still keep asking why I haven't found a girl. When I'm going to grow out of ""that phase in college where I dated guys"". I'm tired of being different. I wish I could just love a woman, or be normal... Whatever. I just want someone to tell me I'll be okay. Thanks Internet. "
There have always been bad people and things happening in the world.

All I am asking is that if  you have a second, go to his YT page I'm linking below and drop a comment of encouragement on a video if you can, a simple ""Where's Gabe?"" or ""Even the best riders go down, can't wait to see you riding again"" would make a world of difference.

"I hear parenthood refocuses a person's priorities and perspective on life.

Even calling the police at risk of him losing his scholarship is better than letting him die. If something does happen, don't blame yourself. You are already doing more than most people would do for an abusive ex.","For reasons I won't get into, I think my abusive ex-boyfriend might commit suicide tomorrow. I hate this person more than I can express to you. He singlehandedly ruined large portions of my life. But I don't think he deserves to die. I don't think anyone deserves to feel like this.I can't contact the authorities without ensuring the removal of his full-ride scholarship with the promise of a job at the end. I think I'm going to anonymously call his parents tonight and let them make that judgement call because it's not my decision to make. They know him best."

I feel like I'm being held back mentally because of my mom. Everyday is different with her mood (she isn't diagnosed with anything that I know of) for example: if I hang out most of the day with my bf, her mood is a flip of a coin once I arrive. If I hang out too often then she flips out on me. I'm afraid of moving out because I don't know the outcome of what will happen which ik won't be good.

I'm here for you. I've grown up in a strict Christian family and can say I know the fear of saying things you've done and then have it eat you up inside.

Im afraid that I wont be accepted or that people will treat me differently or like Im not normal if I do open up about this which is why Im deciding to ask a bunch of internet strangers in another sub that is more suited to my issue (sorry guys but this just isnt the right place for THAT encouragement) I really just need to be encouraged that it is ok to open up and dive into this self exploration. Im truly terrified of what others are going to say or do because of my upbringing (very religious, still am) and the nature of the subject at hand :/ I even went to far as to make an alternate account with a new email so my friends and family that use reddit cant find me on here and find out about this before Im good and ready to tell them."
"Having other people tell You it's fine and give You their insight on the matter really helps, though try not to overuse it or at least not to vent to the same person all the time, otherwise You will become toxic towards that person as they will have to deal not only with their problems but with Yours too. Approaching them sometimes is fine but drowning them in Your problems or only talking to them to vent is not good.

Ghosted by my college friends when I had a family medical emergency and had to withdraw from school, and my best friend blocked me on everything in December.

I do not understand why I suddenly care so much about what people are gonna think to see a 26 year old doing beginner tricks. Especially since my friends are such good supporters, they wouldn't make fun of me even if I super flubbed a trick.I understand confidence is a big factor in magic, in any performance art so I'd love to hear some inspiring words to help me shake off this apprehension.Thank you all ahead of time!"

I'm capable of doing so much art for others at huge speeds (commissions) and in that sense I'm super productive (multiple illustrations a day, even if rhey are small). I can easily sit down in the morning and producing art until before bed, but when it comes to my own stuff, it's almost impossible to just sit down and finish projects, be it an artbook, a plot, a comic, a game... I always end falling back into drawing commissions or illustrations, which I can finish with ease.It seems so many gamedevs or comic artists finished projects by the time they were my age or just a bit younger."

On top of that, her mental health has been beyond terrible for herwhich is likely a huge driving force for the dependencyand Ive gotten Caregivers Fatigue 3 or 4 times already. I desperately want to communicate this issue but she can already read it off of me (been together for a long time) which is making her mental health worse at times, and I think if we were to outright have that conversation it would cause her mental health to be even worse.

I've wanted a masters for a long time with the idea that eventually I'd pursue a new career as a public policy analyst so I've gone back to undergraduate courses in economics and math with the idea if I do well I'll pursue a masters in economics but if not maybe public policy or political science or just go back to work. Of note I'm married with a 6 moth old daughter.Well...I showed up to my first calculus test (I originally passed it with an 89.6 in 2002 but am retaking it to prepare for calculus II) and the teacher told us we couldn't use our calculators and to put them away. We all panic. I didn't even finish the test.
Thank You random person on the internet. I am about to study for my exams,You really can!

But the people I'm with day in and day out don't know. So in some ways I'm still in closest there, but what's hurting me the most is those who I'm out to. My friends will just keep making ""fag"" jokes. My family will still keep asking why I haven't found a girl. When I'm going to grow out of ""that phase in college where I dated guys"".

The workload and material aren't any more difficult than before, but I'm guessing the transition to a new school out of state and away from my family for the first time, in addition to being sick 5 times during the semester, has made it difficult. I have an A, Bs and a C in my other classes at the moment, but my current biology class is the only one I have an F in. I've never failed a class before and I'm trying my hardest to redeem myself and ace the last two exams, but my confidence is not there."
He wanted to stay friends and i did.,The subject of our relationship status got brought up again and she said she was conflicted and part of her wants to just remain friends and part of her wants something more. I asked her if we could talk about it in person but we had to end up FaceTiming. It turns out all that flirting and leading on was her intentionally doing that to see if she was interested. What I took as affection turned out to be experimentation and at this point she was trying to avoid telling me the truth. Ive been rejected before but this one was different. She was leading me on for a month and a half and I thought I was really getting somewhere. The fact that she tried to feel that way for me and couldnt made everything worse. I know this may sound irrational but I cant help feel that there is something wrong with me and that Im screwed up and thats why this happened to me. Every time I put myself out there I get hurt and this one was a huge blow to the gut.

It just makes it sound like I have to hurry everything in my lifestyle and can't take it slow, what a way to do things fast and bad. You can't hurry art!I'd say it's not completely baseless, as there seems to be experiments on rejuvenation already, and I'm in my middle 20s. Of course it does not mean I'm going to live my life carelessly or let it pass me. I already am pretty active to do my best and achieve everything I want to achieve.

I'm starting to regret picking up these new skills- like it feels like I'm trying to compensate or fill a void now.Am I biting off more than I can chew here? Am I doing too much? Is there such a thing as too much learning? Should I stop? I could just use a little direction and confirmation that this choice to learn more will not end up disappointing me in the future."

I asked her if we could talk about it in person but we had to end up FaceTiming. It turns out all that flirting and leading on was her intentionally doing that to see if she was interested. What I took as affection turned out to be experimentation and at this point she was trying to avoid telling me the truth. Ive been rejected before but this one was different. She was leading me on for a month and a half and I thought I was really getting somewhere. The fact that she tried to feel that way for me and couldnt made everything worse. I know this may sound irrational but I cant help feel that there is something wrong with me and that Im screwed up and thats why this happened to me.

I really wish I had something I could say to you to make you feel better. I really wish I had something I could tell you that would fix everything for you.,"Im in too low of a funk to consistently care about maintaining my beard which is as frustrating as daily care would be.

Friend. Im sorry you have to deal with this. I hope you do find a job soon. I especially hope your managers wont be as flaky as the previous ones. Im impressed with the amount of experience you have. I hope it helps you,"I have tons of experience from landscaping making planters for all seasons. I also understand variety, textures, colours etc I am just bogged down by no one giving me a chance. I built a bouquet at an interview and she said she was so impressed, and despite telling me she'd call back, she just ghosted me. I know we are a couple, but I hate using his money for things I want/ need. I have been working since I was 14 (picking fruit on farms during the summer for 2 years) and on my own since 19 (I'm 32). I really hate relying on people and as this point I'm forced to because all my savings are gone. I come from a poorer family and they don't have money to share. I was so excited for the move because I honestly thought I had a great resume, and an awesome portfolio (for landscape design). I have reached out to the design companies in my area and never recieved a courtesy email back."
"Geology looks promising for you. Especially considering it's something you're passionate about. It's certainly been on your mind for a long time. How would you feel if you aged and didn't decide to pursue this dream of yours? Do you think you'd feel safe, knowing that you decided not to spend the money on tuition? Or do you think you'd regret not going for it?This seems like something you really want. So, go for it! Don't do yourself a disservice by trying to be safe. Safety is really not really ever promised anyway.","They love me and are trying to support me, but I think they miss the point... and I've only felt worse since I began making these fears known. To clarify I'm going back for a science BA in geology, a passion of mine. Any sort of words of positivity or encouragement would go a long way for me. I try my best to be an optimist, but lately I feel very pessimistic about this very big deal in my life that I was originally looking so forward to."
I've never worked in a bank before so I don't know how strict they are about these types of mistakes. But it seems to me that it was purely an honest mistake and a learning opportunity. I hope they can see that and give you a second chance. Don't beat yourself up about a mistake though. It's not a life and death mistake and it's not worth stressing too much over. I really hope it works out for the best as it seems like you care about this job - that's not always the case with employees and hopefully your company recognizes that. ,"&amp;#x200B;Wall of text incoming. TL;DR: I made a mistake yesterday at work by revealing private information about a customer, and now I'm afraid I will get fired.

I work at a bank where we need to verify every customer that calls in. I started at this job 2 months ago, and I received a call that I'd never dealt with before.

"Do something you wouldn't normally do, join an improv group, a yoga class, something to meet new people and do new things.Also, I'm a PhD student in Chemical Engineering, I too was homeless for like 4 months after a breakup, living on friend's couches and air mattresses - and now I live with people who are awesome and I'm slowly rebuilding my life. Don't get me wrong, it's fucking hard - but what else can we do?","A little over a month ago I was tossed out of my apartment by my now ex-girlfriend.  I was sleeping on my friends couch for a week, and then my job asked me if I wanted to travel to another location temporarily.  Originally it was supposed to be 30 days, but I signed another 90 day commitment so my total time out will be 120 days.  It has just sunk in on me that I'm effectively homeless, living out of a hotel room with nowhere to go.  Fortunately my job put me in the hotel and are paying for it.  I just need someone to give me words of encouragement."
"My suggestion is to keep singing and keep creating content. Theres the phrase If you build, we will come.The phrase I give to you is If you sing, they will come.","I am still in a bad predicament, though I know things can't stay here forever. I just wanted to ask you guys for some encouragement (and maybe some advice.) I have ALWAYS loved singing. When I was a young girl, I sang all the time. My family wasn't supportive. They're the kind that ALWAYS makes fun, even if you're good, because they're jokesters. When I got into school, I jumped into choir as soon as it was available to me. 6th grade. And I loved it so much. When I got to 7th grade, we moved to a new school and the choir teacher there was amazing. She encouraged me, and gave me more and more responsibility for my section and countless solos before adding me to her elite choir that went around and performed live at different places in our city. Even within that choir, she gave me solos and encouraged me."

And I don't want her to convince her to love me, but I just really care about her, and I'm just confused at how fast this entire thing happened. And really, I just don't want to she her hurt herself when she's living on her own with (almost literally) no guardrails or anything in her life- just kind of feeling it in the moment, and doing whatever she feels like, because I just want her to at least take care of herself and not do anything she will regret.I just need some encouragement. I don't know what else to do."

Has her food changed since bringing her home? Ours was on crappy shelter food and we had about a week and a half of accidents while she adjusted to new diet. The thing that really helped was getting her some doggy probiotics bc the farts were ridiculous lol. ,"Hey all. My girlfriend and I just adopted a rescue dog (German Sheppard) and brought her home yesterday. The thing is, she is a REALLY tough case and really put us through our paces last night and this morning. We could really just use a little cheerleading to boost us up and keep us going for a minute. We've both had tough dogs before, but it's been a stressful time in general so it is extra tough at the moment. Thanks! <3"
"Keep your head up, dont lose yourself when its hard. much love","I know my problems aren't worse than others. I know of all days today is definitely one of the easiest situations I've been put through in life. Today just hit me differently. I woke up really groggy and sleepy to get ready for work while worrying about my gf who has spine complications causing her endless pain. I tried to drive to work after pulling myself together but couldn't go because the road to get to my job was replaced by a ditch for construction.I have been raped, beaten by family, bullied most my life and jumped on multiple occasions. But today? Today feels so. Hard. I know I shouldn't be feeling sorry for myself but I really need a hand to be able to stand right now. I'm crying and have no idea why maybe it's just mood swings but everything feels awful and I don't know how to fix myself"
"You didn't explicitly say or strongly imply that you are suicidal, but when you are feeling really down on yourself, that can happen.","22m, I've made some mistakes in the last year that have now led to a period of depression, regrets, anxiety, feeling like a disappointment and just wishing i wasn't born. I know it's not the end of the world and I am trying to push through by fixing my mistakes where i can and starting afresh but every other day there's always a new thing that makes it hard. I keep getting scared that i might snap and just give up. I figured hearing peoples stories and how they got through might help a bit, so what are your stories and what helped you survive?"
failing earth science isn't too bad. but i think having a mom or family that doesn't know what you're going through and is unnecessarily harsh is. i hope you can reach out to somebody including your mom and ask for encouragement as well. i know you can do it !,"These past 4 days have been awful and I don't know what to do anymore. It all started on Thursday ( some context I'm 16) I got a call during school lunchtime that my best friend Jay(18) had been arrested for assault, he had beat his sister's  abusive boyfriend half to death so I'll probably never see him again but then an hour later I hear from my good friend John that my friend Mike(15) will be moving out of state because he got his girlfriend pregnant. Oh and not being able to see 2 of my friends wasn't enough I got pulled into the counselors office and told that I will be repeating earth science and that I will be taking a course over the summer."
Self-worship is a lonely religion. Children and society at large suffer because of it. You're doing the right thing to focus on being a good mother to your son.,"I'm trying to defend myself and he tells me to shut the fuck up. We walk to the car and while driving I tell him that he was being ridiculous and getting upset over non-trivial things once again. He proceeds to slap my phone off of my stand in my car and stomp on it. I become irate and start telling him how I didn't appreciate him destroying property. We get back to his mother's house and she can tell something is wrong with me. So, I ask to speak to her one on one to show her what he did to my phone. Instead of letting me talk in private he intrudes on our conversation and starts antagonizing me telling me that I don't know how to keep my mouth shut and our business is between me and him. He starts to berate me again and follow me throughout the house and outside."
Seven years later i meet a great man who loves me for my good and bad. He lets me rant over death of penmanship and how its a lost art.,The subject of our relationship status got brought up again and she said she was conflicted and part of her wants to just remain friends and part of her wants something more. I asked her if we could talk about it in person but we had to end up FaceTiming. It turns out all that flirting and leading on was her intentionally doing that to see if she was interested. What I took as affection turned out to be experimentation and at this point she was trying to avoid telling me the truth. Ive been rejected before but this one was different. She was leading me on for a month and a half and I thought I was really getting somewhere. The fact that she tried to feel that way for me and couldnt made everything worse. I know this may sound irrational but I cant help feel that there is something wrong with me and that Im screwed up and thats why this happened to me. Every time I put myself out there I get hurt and this one was a huge blow to the gut.
"You have a good head on your shoulders. You're keeping yourself and your son safe and that's important. Its ok to be sad when any relationship ends. Good or bad, short or long. Take care of yourself. It sounds like you already know how to do that.","I try to get him to participate but all he said to me was ""I do it when I feel like it"" and continues to act childish, so I give up and wait for people to return to the common area.When we're on our way home, he conveniently starts talking to me telling me how he wants to catch the baby and I ignore him. He doesn't like the fact that I didn't respond to his request so he starts berating me saying, ""that's why all black women are single mothers, because all of you are dysfuctional, you're dysfunctional."" I snap and tell him that ""he was a bitch for the way acted at the birthing center."" Then he mushes me in the head, and I told him to stop touching me, and then he says to me ""what are you going to do about it?"" I responded that I will tell a family member about what he is doing."
"My hearth goes out to you right now, and I hope things start to look up for you.","Ghosted by my college friends when I had a family medical emergency and had to withdraw from school, and my best friend blocked me on everything in December. The only explanation I can think of for getting blocked is that she was hoping this guy (who she said had major insecurity issues) would ask her out, and my assumption is that he made her block me.Student loans are beating me down because I dont know if its financially worth it to shoot for my dream. What good is it if I have to work a job in addition to my career just to pay off my loans?Im just having a rough time, and its getting to meEdit: I also find myself misdirecting my anger because Im so upset with my life.

You can do it!!! Everyone fails at getting driving licences and have to try many times!,"Hey there everyone! I am a Russian guy who desperately tries to get a driving license for himself but have failed miserably 3 times already. I am here for the 4th time trying to get into the right mindset to I finally accomplish what I want today but I am awfully nervous. The thing is that when I drive with an instructor from driving school where I went, I feel at ease and I relatively good at it but when it comes to passing the test and I have an officer riding shotgun who observes me driving, assessing me, I am get all messed up. I get so nervous that my mouth becomes dry, palms sweat, feet shake and I just cant get my mind straight. I am so mad because of that. I know that I have enough skill to pass the test but this nervousness gets the best of me."
I stayed with a guy for 8 years bc i loved him.,"On top of all this, I had a falling out with one of my best friends and he turned some of my other friends against me. I just cant help but feel like everything bad that happens in my life is a direct result of my actions. I had no reason to think that the girl I was talking to would have liked me in the first place. We were barely friends before but after I asked for her number we got really close. She said the reason she doesnt want to make our relationship anything more is because she doesnt want to destroy the relationship we have right now. I dont know how true that actually is. I want to be friends with her but I dont know if she honestly values our friendship or if that is just a load of crap to make me feel better. I feel like Im a failure and I feel like I hurt everyone I'm involved with. If youve read all of this I appreciate it and any advice is appreciated"
"The best advice I can give, is to be patient with her. Ive been in similar situations, and pushing to open up has never been fruitful. You both are growing, and experiencing new things. She probably doesnt know how to communicate her feelings just yet. I know it may be hard, but focus on building you at the same time letting her know youre still her best friend.","So, I've been best friends for a year and a half with a girl(I am a guy) and I'm talking the kind of friendship that we can tell each other anything and everything and know that the other isn't going to judge and is just there to listen and give advice.In November I finally told her that I had feelings for her after debating in my head for 4 months. She said she also had feelings for me and we were proud of each other for finally letting it out. However, ever since then it feels like there is a rift in the friendship that I had zero intention of creating, you see, I never fully wanted to get into a relationship as she had just started her freshman year of college and I am in my Junior year of highschool(we're only a year apart in age) so we were both stressed with school."
"It may seem unsettling to hear but is it possible you may have depression? If so, please know that there are so many resources out there to help you. Reddit has so many kind people and resources to aid other strangers on the web.","I know Im young, Im under no delusions that Im fully mature and that this is it, but I cant shake this feeling that Ill NEVER shake this. I have goals and dreams that I am actively sabotaging, and I need to stop. Its a lot to ask, I know, but could anyone offer some advice, or words of encouragement? Right now the idea that Ill fix myself up just seems completely alien to me."
Consistent meds and regular therapy. ,"Hi guys, I have a bipolar disorder and my last job interview didn't went well. I just lost my job and I'm not doing well. I feel so broken. Can anyone give me a tips so I don't mess up again? It's hard for me to focus because of my mental illness. Is there anything that I can do to overcome this?"
"Finding a group with similar interests as you might help as well. See if you're coworkers are into the same sports or wanna go see a movie. A church, a workplace, a 5K, whatever might be where your next relationship grows!","Been here 6 months but have no close friends, just had a hard week with a particularly disappointing dating rejection after a long month with difficulty sleeping. Loneliness is piling up and I'm having a hard time right now.Didn't even know this subreddit was a thing, I just typed it in because I hoped it existed. I could really use some encouragement right now.Thanks. :/"
"Is it the stresses of day to day life that are threatening to crush you, a specific event, or is it something coming from inside yourself?","Right now Im sitting in my dark and empty house and I dont know if I can do this thing called life. Ive been battling this demon for years now. No one knows whats really going on with me. Ive tried to talk to people about it but they all have the same carbon copied answers - Youre gonna be okay. Itll get better soon. Im sorry youre going through this. I dont think I will though. I know I need to talk this out with a professional, but I cant afford that or the insurance to cover it. Its cruel how the world keeps on going after your own world lies in ashes at your feet. Tbh, I feel empty inside."
"The point is, you are your own worst critic.",I have a mild/severe lisp and a double chin (f genetics) I think Im ugly and really I have few people that I can compare to that are remotely as ugly as I am. COVID lost any social status I had (not like I had any from high school but) I have literally at school 0 ZERO friends just a few people trying to befriend me for stuff. I also have a writing disability and I tend to stutter and be annoying talking and overtaking the conversation (that can sometimes be good) but yeah I wanna rebuild my life from ground 0 any help?
An opportunity to find yourself and know who you are and keeping up with that good eating habit,"A small and easy way to do it was to completely wreck my quarantine habits. I've been eating like an absolute mess and haven't worked-out at all for the last few days. I also haven't touched my musical instruments, which I normally practice pretty much every day. Everything is less fun, less interesting, less joyful, etc. I can be distracted for a while, but my energy level and general happiness is much lower than usual. Do you guys have any advice or encouragement?"
They will believe you. I remember learning about abusive relationships in high school and this was just like one of the main examples.,"Just need a little encouragement. A man threatened suicide when I told him I no longer wanted to date. I helped him get help and when I thought the situation deescalated, I left. He since has sent numerous texts and emails. Finally, he sent a 4-page letter to my house claiming that I caused all of the anxiety, depression, and desire to end it all. I filed a PFA (protection from abuse) against him. He is an abuser and its going to take a lot to be in the same room as him tomorrow - and to listen to him make up his version of reality, and to fight the protection I am seeking.I am hoping against hope that the judge believes me and is willing to grant this order to give me some peace of mind."
"HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!  And ALSO, good job on keeping a close eye on your account, knowing your bank balance, and paying your bills on time.  Having to keep to a tight budget sucks, but you're doing great.  I hope you could plan to have your party some other time; even though it won't be exactly on your birthday, there's no reason not to celebrate anyway.",So...Today I was planning on giving myself a pizza birthday with anyone who wanted to join on my campus. I only have two friends. I got a check for $100 yesterday that I cashed and I have been looking forward to this all week. Even after my birthday that happened this past Wednesday. I had some bills to pay like hulu and neflix which I didn't mind. But i made sure that I was saving enough to I could buy the stuff. I got on the bus. Got some drinks for myself and I got two bracelets from hot topic too but what I didn't realize was that most of my billing stuff happened today.
Good luck! Deep breaths,About to go take my first driving test here in an hour. I dont really have anyone to talk about this with so I figured Id make something here. I have a lot riding on me passing since the person I get a ride to work with wont be available to help anymore. And if Im being honest Im really nervous.
"This forces you to slow down, not take in too much oxygen and hyperventilate.

This feels complicated. Let's take a step back and separate the different things that are going on here. I'm hearing that you don't enjoy conversation or hanging out with these folks.,"It's practicality become an addiction to get on Xbox the second I get home instead of practicing guitar or working out, stuff I want to do. Even when I thought I could trust him for good advice when I told him that I was depressed he said some bullshit about, ""depression isn't real,"" and ""most people are just looking for pity."" It's degrading to talk to him, and his posy. I just don't know if it's worth it to abandon years of voices and personalities for something I'm not even sure if I have the commitment to do. What do you guys think?"
"I think part of the issue lies with relativism, too. Without getting too abstract or philosophical -- helping others is seen as somehow less beneficial than just looking out for yourself. The whole ""what's in it for me?""","I just realized something discouraging.  r/RoastMe and other forums dedicated to negativity are freakin' massive (1.2M?!).  Disproportionately large compared to r/encouragement or whatever is trending the opposite way.Is it more difficult to do good in this world?  Especially because suffering is a real problem that most people seem content to ignore.I don't care, how difficult it is though.  I like helping people.  Do you?"
"It cuts you down when people sneer, smirk, joke, bully, make fun of, etc... at you and it is hurtful. Yes, completely! But, the thing is, honestly, those people are hurting just as much (if not more) and are just better at hiding it.","There's a reason I work the evening shift. I know this is a petty thing to get hung up on in the face of such an otherwise-perfect opportunity, but it's been a VERY long time since I've been required to get up early on a regular basis. And now I'm on medication with a side effect of insomnia. My current situation is unsustainable, and these early classes will allow me to stick with my usual evening shift; but I have a long history of being easily discouraged and can already feel myself backpedaling. I need someone to talk me out of talking myself out of this."
"Hey thats awesome I wish you the very best. I dont know if you believe in God OP but I pray that you will find favor. That you might find the right words and be filled with boldness.

"However, you dont deserve anything less than a hearty fuck yeah I want to be with you, whether it lasts or doesnt.","I guess Ill explain my situation. For about 3 months now Ive been talking to this girl. After our first date she said she didnt feel anything for me and so I tried to move on. After about a week of not talking to her she texted me asking how my day was. Since that day she started talking to me non stop every day. She then started to get kind of flirty and lead me on. When I talked to her about it, she said she was confused because she didnt feel anything originally and now she thinks things are changing. I was excited and so I just kept doing what I was doing and things were going great. Things went bad on Friday the 27th."
But i made sure that I was saving enough to I could buy the stuff. I got on the bus.,"I went to school one day came back and it was gone. My older brother walks in and said he had to sell my guitar and amp to help pay for his rent which was a joke cause he was doing drugs at the time. I was taught by my foster parents that everything had a price for it even if it was a gift so I get really anxious when someone gives me a gift cause I think, ""Oh shit what's the price for taking this?"" I just... I felt really bad that even though I was able to get like $14 of drinks and two cool bracelets too.

"It has a been a rough road with lots of rocky starts, but now that I'm past all the major bumps that made me worried I made a horrible decision, I am so happy that I made this change. Things may get rough - positive progress is always challenging.","last Saturday I got my first job outside of Upwork after a week.:)I know that I am being impatient and that these things take time, I can rationalize that...But I would love some words of encouragement in these times.Any advice is also welcome.Thank you in advance."
"If you are struggling mentally I would suggest seeking an academic advisor or a therapist for help. Speaking from my own experiences, when I took first year calculus I made sure to find friends who could help me, visit the professor to discuss the homework or any difficult concepts, and find tutoring options to help me understand the material better.","Sorry for formatting or mistakes, im on my phone and currently crying in the bathroom over first year university calculus, i opened up a ""quiz"" (can be tried as many times until we've gotten over 75% to unlock the current weeks videos) and i just exited out because the first question had me stumped. I havent done the homework yet, and I know that this isn't the way to go, i should havd done homework first to guage how well i know the material before stressing. But I've had this mental block all day, and just this mental block in general that I can't actually be confident in my math skills. And i always have this self doubt. I just have thus idea that I can never be smart in all things math, I'm trying to have a growth mindset but its so hard."
"Hey Carbon, you sound really intelligent from how you write! You've got a plan towards your dreams, it just wasn't what you originally thought it was going to be. Life is like that sometimes. It takes a really strong person to stand up from failure and continue to persevere to their dreams.","It was when I was put on academic recovery, I realized the consequences of what I had done and the potential effect it had on me wanting to achieve my goal of getting into a D.O school or M.D. School. It was then, I realized, I didnt want to live my life anymore. So I got help, and it was through that help I got to where I am today. I left that crowd behind, I gained control over alcohol and I actively pushed for my education cause at the end of the day I know I had a goal in mind of becoming a Neurosurgeon or just getting into D.O or M.D. school. So I went hard back to work and brought my grades up. My gpa at the end of my junior year was a 1.9 overall and now it sits at a 2.69. Now I know by no means, does this make me a competitive student or applicant despite my upward trend."
"I'm praying for you, man. I see that you're trying to make an effort. That is great. I encourage you to keep trying and to maybe pursue that idea when you feel healthy enough to do that, but in due time, there is no rush.","I didnt deserve this, I hadnt worked for it at all, it was literally something I thought of while I was laying in bed after hitting the snooze button.That was the exact moment my psychotic break triggered.

"I have been in a similar situation, PTSD, had to live with my brother but it was for a limited amount of time.  You're doing the right things and it's tough. It will get better.  Making mental health treatment a priority and quitting drinking helped me get to a stable situation on my own.  Never feel like you're alone.","I try to stay in my room and not make a mess. I try to get up with my niece and let my brother and sister sleep in when I am able. I haven't even been there 6 months. My sister in law expressed that she wanted me out last night. After they encourage me to go to my best friend's wedding in another state and get involved in a local sport (which cost money), I was informed that she was pissed that I had bought sports equipment the other night and that it was becoming time for me to leave. She wasn't mean about it. She just stated that it was time for her to have her space back. I'm worried that after all the changes I have been making, I'm back where I started. I'm in a job that can't sustain me financially. I don't know how I'm going to afford my bills if I move out by February."
"I hope you find a job soon, and I hope it treats you well.What Ive learned from my experience is that when it comes to jobs, if the work environment is good, then youll love the job. Its no so much the field as it is the environment. So my advice is to choose a job with a good environment for you. Then youll learn to like the job.","I fear for my own future especially career wise. I do want to have a career in something that I love. Something that even on the worst of Monday's and even though it's very hard work I'll just love doing it. Unfortunately, I don't think I'll ever have that. I was born in Toronto Ontario Canada and I'm Autistic and as a child I was misdiagnosed and wasn't given the treatments and therapy I needed. I was put into a special class but it was for kids with ADHD which was what I was misdiagnosed with which I didn't have. Well, I never did well in school because I didn't get the help I needed. To make a long story short I just wasn't making my milestones or coming anywhere close to them so my parents pulled me out of school and homeschooled me."
"It's rare to hear from someone struggling with depression who's so focused on doing for others.It sounds like you have an excellent foundation to work from to build something truly meaningful out of a life that already sounds like it's meaningful to others.

Its best not to get into an argument and never to start one. Whatever someones says just leave it to them. I wouldnt think too much about your friends. If its time to separate then its time. A real heart of a friend would stay through the right and the wrong.,"He clearly doesnt get the support he needs and hes a bully. I just left the discord and Im trying to get some of my friends to join my new one but only one has joined and he says he might not stay for long. I really need some encouragement right now, so Im asking a bunch of internet strangers. P.s. taking a walk to cool down hopefully it makes me feel better.Update: one of my friends was trying to force us to talk before I was ready. After a bit I got to stop. Thanks for all the advise it means a lot."
How old is the dog? If a puppy then the energy might ease up a bit. Plus him/her getting used to new exciting environment. We have a half German Shepherd who is 1.5. I believe they require opportunity to exercise and play but are also very trainable.,"Hey all. My girlfriend and I just adopted a rescue dog (German Sheppard) and brought her home yesterday. The thing is, she is a REALLY tough case and really put us through our paces last night and this morning. We could really just use a little cheerleading to boost us up and keep us going for a minute. We've both had tough dogs before, but it's been a stressful time in general so it is extra tough at the moment. Thanks! <3"
"Dont sweat it man, its a nice gesture and she will love it. I think now is a good time to look back on our 2012 friends and remember the YOLO saying... You only get one chance in life so take every shot you can no matter how many you miss the ones that you make will make it all worth it. Good luck man.","Some background: I work inventory for a website that sells trading cards, and I've been mildly crushing on a coworker for awhile now. She's nice, funny, quiet, shy, cute, and from the little bit we've interacted she seems like an interesting person. We haven't interacted much outside of passing conversation because I'm also a pretty quiet and shy person, so the few times I've had the chance I've never been able to think of a way to interact with her without it seeming very forced or making it awkward for one or both of us. The crush level has gone up recently because she got me a cheesecake platter for my birthday. Not an unusual thing as she's always bringing in cookies for everyone but it made my day all the same."
"Tough, wow!You're in a tough spot and the consequences are hitting you really hard. You have to hit that bottom of making bad choices and facing the consequences. Sounds like you're definitely there.Consider applying for jobs close by. Take public transit or walk. Ride a bicycle.","it got to the point where I was terrified to go into work and all they told me was to just leave him alone. so I quit. every time something good happens 10 bad things happen.

The more the merrier I suppose.,so I know nobody will probably see this but Im going to rant sorry if you came here for something else and Im wasting your time but I guess I need some advice.
"Well, friend I would discourage you from self harm. It will not help you feel better.",it comes and stays for a while and stays and stays never fully goes away my depression comes from school and my family it grows more and more every day there's this boy I like a lot and he makes me happier but I hide most of my problems from him because i don't want him to worry school is tuff and I don't know how to stay focused during homework and I cant seem to get the stress off of my back.my mom bugs me about managing my time and she's right but all she does is make me feel guilty and unwanted. all i have been wanting to do now is just die die die die die die die die die die.and i keep thinking about it. I stay up late doing homework because I can't manage my time correctly and I'm getting low grades.
"Sorry that my response took so long, but things will most definitely work out. You don't have to be close to a professor to ask for a recommendation. You also don't have to have a passion to make a difference and be happy. If you aren't sure what you want to do, then let's think through who you want to be. Who/what traits do you respect? We're all just children blindly fumbling through life. Everyone gets Imposter Syndrome. Everyone is just making it until they make it. ","However, just looking at everyone around me, i'm just so far behind. I don't have concrete plans. I don't have a 5-year or 10-year plan. Right now, I just have a general idea. I want to go places, learn different languages and understand different cultures, study and get a masters degree abroad. I have saved a bit for this. I just don't think I'm good enough to get accepted into a program, let alone be considered for a scholarship (my GWA is only 1.93, I wasn't really close enough to any of my college professors so I don't think I can just ask for a recommendation letter, i didn't have any extra-curricular activity in college). I know it's not practical and maybe it is just a pipe dream.But I'm still going through the motions, questioning the point of life. Don't worry, I'm not suicidal. I just don't see my purpose in life right now and I'm struggling.Please don't think that I'm whining."
"Sometimes there are no words to ask for help.  We've all been there, it's not stupid. =)Hang in there, my friend.  If the words come to you later, we're here to talk it over.  You're not alone in this.",I don't know what to say and this is really stupid. I'm just asking for some good thoughts this way. I'm so tired and discouraged and don't want to do this anymore. Please think of me.
"Develop outside hobbies, try to find groups of people who can do things you like with you - try meetup for example.","I really need a girl in my life to help me, I have a more sensitive side that I'm showing now that needs to be vented.

I am such a sincere and open-minded person and girls always turn me down, or claim to really like me a friend ( I'm fine with that) and later avoid me. Finally, I met an adorable girl recently who I connect with so well, but she only wanted to be friends, which I agreed to, yet now she always has a lame excuse to ignore me. I just feel lost and underappreciated"
As for the phone that one really stinks.I have suffered and learned through practice that one of the best things to do is to just focus on blessings.,"This is going to also sound ridiculous, but my new phone (no case, no screen protector) somehow slid off the surface I placed it on while doing something this late at night, causing it to hit the hard floor screen first, getting itself some small scratches on its corners in the process. I know the scratches arent that bad, but my obsessive compulsive disorder really tests my tolerance when it comes to the smallest things. And it was a new phone that Ive only had for a couple of weeks, for crying out loud! Ive just been self deprecating for the past two hours, so far.In sum from all of this, how do I effectively diminish the thought of I could have done this to prevent this or that so I can learn from these small situations that have been bothering me for the past couple of hours? I guess I somehow have a compass as to how I can solve this, but hearing something from somebody else would really encourage me."

Im sorry that I cant really give much advice. I just hope you can find some encouragement knowing that you arent alone in your fears. I feel the same way and Im scared that I wont ever find anybody who actually has feelings for me. The only advice I can give is keep pushing through. Im not going to try to tell you you wont face rejection and pain. The only thing you can really do is power through and better yourself. Dont give up!,"I've been reading some things on Reddit that have re-activated my fears of never getting a partner. It's like a massive weightful dread and sadness that I don't know what to do with. I looked up and found this subreddit because I feel like a withered plant who never got any masculine encouragement to try different risky things and take action despite fears, including talking to girls. And I feel starved for female attention as well, which creates a self-perpetuating cycle. I would love if I had men and women in my life who supported me with approaching people socially, either for romantic purposes or just trying crazy things."
"Make a list of things you really enjoy, and make sure you schedule even short periods of down time to enjoy those things.

I felt that way many times throughout my studies. Just understand that your determination and perseverance in trying to understand a material and your strong desire to learn about subjects are more important to me than being knowledgeable enough to pass quizzes and tests.,"in school, i can say im a try-hard, im the one with lots of notes. who actually tries to study and listen in class. i try to projects way earlier than it's due. especially now in online class, i do hws, that are supposed to be passed next week, on the day it was given. that's just me.but the thing is i sometimes feel like that's the only thing im good that. being organized and being able to get my requirements done. anything other than that im dumb unless i study really hard. earlier, i had a quiz and i failed. and it's okay, but I felt discouraged becausr i try so hard yet im not smart enought to get good grades. it makes studying, for me, harder.i dont know and honestly this isn't even that deep compared to other problems here :))) i just needed to rant"

We are more anxious and depressed these days because of our culture. With the internet and media we are under a microscope and we are constantly being pressured to be perfect. Perfect body, perfect skin, perfect routine, perfect eating habits, the way you sleep, the way the way you stand, the way you parent, perfect fulfilled fun lives. Every single thing we do we are pressured with the fact that we arent good enough. We arent doing it right. We arent doing it perfectly. We live in an illusion that some people are but its all just a magic trick. People put on a fake face. No one truly knows whats real anymore, so we sit there thinking we arent good enough, we arent as good as everyone else. We have access to all the bad news around the world like never  before."
"Sorry you are going through this.It is common that people close to you will refuse your desire for growth because they might feel rejected by it.Find a support group of like minded individuals (look up the power of mastermind groups).Successful people generally have to build their own inner circle because most do not automatically come from a situation where they are already surrounded with success-minded peers.Know that you are on a difficult path, but a path many have tread. Find those that believe in your strength. Stay positive.","I have a shitty job and a very unsupportive family. While having dinner, I told them about my plans to leave my full time job and build my own career on freelancing.

I know freelancing is hard like really really hard but its something that makes me happy (I currently have a part time job which is essentially what Ill be doing as a freelancer) and I know starting from the very beginning will be extremely hard but Im mentally prepared for it. Ive also saved enough money to live for a year which Im confident that Ill be able to get clients by then.

And from then on, the prices got bigger. I learned how to paint, i became the soloist of my choir, i learned to cook. Nothing was enough.

I also was unhealthy in most aspects of my life and remember coming home and crying in my room a lot.,I just feel like I have nothing going for me anymore. The only thing I can say Im motivated about is starting up my own kicking camp to teach high school football kickers the most important techniques and tips for training and in game situations. Besides that I cant find something to hold on to that would keep my head high and keep my motivation running. I just feel lost and empty and I wish I could ask for help but I know Ive already asked too many times. What are some tips you would have to keep a persons motivation running?

I guess I'm just asking for any encouragement on this situation. I don't even know how to take my first step forward. I have been crying almost all of my waking hours since about 10pm last night.

Im afraid of losing those I care about. Im afraid that Im not good enough.

"I don't know if this works in Canada, but I know for sure in the US you don't need a high school diploma to enroll in some two year colleges.","Now, when my parents homeschooled me there wasn't much information about it and not a whole lot of people did it, it just wasn't as common as it is now. There wasn't as many curriculum's then as there is now and the curriculum's weren't as advanced as the one's now. So, anyways when my parents pulled me out of school I was in the 5th grade but after testing me on a few things to see where I was, most of what I knew was a kindergarten level maybe grade one. So, it was very hard work but I did catch up, although unfortunately because my Autism (it's not my parents fault, they honestly tried and so did I) I wasn't able to do the work required of me to graduate. There were subjects I just couldn't grasp and understand at the time. So, I wasn't able to graduate high school."

You are doing the right thing. It shows that you care about yourself and your own well being. And Im happy about that. Keep at it my friend. Self care is important. And who knows?

"Venting certainly helps relieve stress: whether it's on a blog, in some artwork, written letters... however you can express yourself.  The negative experiences tend to stick in our minds, and it's good to let them pass through.I'd also encourage you to focus on positive things too.  We tend to become the things we focus on.  It helps to remember that there are blessings all around us, even in bad times.  Even one enjoyable moment, savored and recalled, can lead us to seek more.","Been feeling like crap for about a year now, thought about creating a blog to vent it out since I cant seem to speak the words out loud.

When we get comfortable at something we avoid going through the process of re-aligning to anything else. Because it takes away our peace and identity. We lose out on something which was very dear to us, when our identity is lost, hope also takes a backseat and we are left hanging just to be tossed around by the unprecedented consequences, like in this Covid. This begs some fundamental questions, where does your identity lie? What things are you putting your hope on? Weve seen and understood clearly nothing is permanent.

As deadlines come and go, I realized the dream of going to medical school is slowly going away.I looked at so many masters programs or other programs to help boost my GPA but I always fall short of the requirements due to my overall GPA. My passion is the healthcare field, being able to help patients hands on and seeing the progression of getting them healthier over time but despite all that my GPA is whats holding me back.

"Hey Carbon, you sound really intelligent from how you write! You've got a plan towards your dreams, it just wasn't what you originally thought it was going to be. Life is like that sometimes. It takes a really strong person to stand up from failure and continue to persevere to their dreams.",":Around July I applied to a masters in biomedical sciences at NOVA. This was a specialized program in Florida aimed to help student with below standards to boost their application into medical school or dental school. You needed a minimum of a 2.5 gpa to apply and this was my last chance to get into medical school as if you got in and completed the program you were able to receive an interview to their medical school. Which in my eyes was a good thing because a lot of people apply and most dont get interviews. Well if I could cut the curve and gone to interviews then I beat more than the people and had a higher chance. However I ultimately didnt get accepted. So I decided it was time to not necessarily stop my dreams of medical school, but rather but it on pause and do something else for a bit and if the cards play out, reapply to medical school later down the road.

I felt really bad and tried to apologize, but she is mostly ignoring me.

"If anything, maybe your studying should be a useful escape from all of it.  Nothing else matters.  Do you study at home?

I don't have a girlfriend, my job is not really one where I'm ""going anywhere"" with. I'm on probation with a looming court date.

I put on weight. 100 lbs. I tried to do call centers. Found out that years of emotional abuse had made it so I just sob when customers yell at me. Tried to go back to warehouse work but the pain in my legs, feet, hips and back was excruciating. Only lasted 3 months. Husband was the bread winner and I did literally everything else. All he had to do was bring home a check. I scheduled appointments, paid bills, cleaned the house, planned meals, grocery shopped, etc. I was already doing that while also working. It was nice to only do one side of it. We bought a house. 1 month later my husband lost his job of 7 years. In the 2 years since, he has worked a total of 5 months. We cashed out his 401k. It lasted a year."

There wasn't as many curriculum's then as there is now and the curriculum's weren't as advanced as the one's now. So, anyways when my parents pulled me out of school I was in the 5th grade but after testing me on a few things to see where I was, most of what I knew was a kindergarten level maybe grade one. So, it was very hard work but I did catch up, although unfortunately because my Autism (it's not my parents fault, they honestly tried and so did I) I wasn't able to do the work required of me to graduate. There were subjects I just couldn't grasp and understand at the time. So, I wasn't able to graduate high school."

And I quit suddenly. No other job lined up. I didn't know what I was doing, all I knew was that I couldn't stay there. I couldn't spend my life tearing people down.

I hope you know somewhere out there, someone is rooting for you and your fiance and wishing you well.","Ive been on a downward spiralMy fianc and I have moved in together at the start of 2020, which either highlighted or exposed some major dependency issues that she has. On top of that, her mental health has been beyond terrible for herwhich is likely a huge driving force for the dependencyand Ive gotten Caregivers Fatigue 3 or 4 times already. I desperately want to communicate this issue but she can already read it off of me (been together for a long time) which is making her mental health worse at times, and I think if we were to outright have that conversation it would cause her mental health to be even worse. She also gets upset that it seems like I view her as helpless and unable to function without me, and admittedly I do because shes so extremely needyI hate myself physically.

I stayed with a guy for 8 years bc i loved him.,The subject of our relationship status got brought up again and she said she was conflicted and part of her wants to just remain friends and part of her wants something more. I asked her if we could talk about it in person but we had to end up FaceTiming. It turns out all that flirting and leading on was her intentionally doing that to see if she was interested. What I took as affection turned out to be experimentation and at this point she was trying to avoid telling me the truth. Ive been rejected before but this one was different. She was leading me on for a month and a half and I thought I was really getting somewhere. The fact that she tried to feel that way for me and couldnt made everything worse. I know this may sound irrational but I cant help feel that there is something wrong with me and that Im screwed up and thats why this happened to me. Every time I put myself out there I get hurt and this one was a huge blow to the gut.

What stopped me from doing that was the unintentional (at least, I think it was) pressure my family and relatives put on me; out of all 6 grandchildren, I was the only one who was doing significantly well in university; my two older cousins both dropped out of their undergrad after about 5 weeks, because they couldn't cope with the level of difficulty (I'm not in any way throwing shade, people can choose to do whatever they want in their lives and I honestly couldn't give less of a flying fig)."

I just don't know how possible that is, or even if it's possible at all. I had so many dreams as a kid of things I wanted to be when I grew up. When I was very young I wanted to be President Of The United States (I didn't know that as a kid born in Canada that one had to be born in U.S.A to be the President but I was a young kid.) I dreamed of being a lawyer or having my own business and owning a corporation."

My mindset is that I wasted a lot of time focusing on trying to get into medical school that I really needed to become serious and not waste anymore time. I want to start a program in the spring of 2021. Most application deadlines are October 6. After reviewing my transcript, I needed to take Nutrition, Anatomy and Physiology and microbiology. I registered this semester to take all of them. They dont start till October 14th but most programs let you still apply to them so long as the classes are completed by the time the program starts. So I still have time."

I hope you're happy with your dram deal :)",I am a struggling makeup student for 3 years and I finally got my first paid job for working on set for a short film. I was extremely anxious over it and stayed in a hotel for 4 days just to get some work experience which I never thought I could do this early on in my course. I did it and smashed it and I wasnt tagged in the promo post by the director who is also a student btw when he tagged everyone else. My parents werent too fussed either. I thought this was gonna be this massive achievement but now I feel like maybe I shouldnt feel so proud of myself as I am.

As deadlines come and go, I realized the dream of going to medical school is slowly going away.I looked at so many masters programs or other programs to help boost my GPA but I always fall short of the requirements due to my overall GPA.

Congratulations on your bio degree,"I recently finished a BSc in biology (the thought-process was to start off in biology, and segway into vet-school after a couple of years). I ended up changing my mind about vet-school pretty early into my bachelor's, and that's when I started thinking about changing my major to something artsy (I had always had a passion for writing). What stopped me from doing that was the unintentional (at least, I think it was) pressure my family and relatives put on me; out of all 6 grandchildren, I was the only one who was doing significantly well in university; my two older cousins both dropped out of their undergrad after about 5 weeks, because they couldn't cope with the level of difficulty (I'm not in any way throwing shade, people can choose to do whatever they want in their lives and I honestly couldn't give less of a flying fig)."

So Im not an artist but heres my idea:Since you excel at commissions try to treat your own work like a commission.,"I'm an artist with original story ideas, many of them over 10 years old, but I've never been able to sit down and finish them. And that fact tends to extend to so many projects. I'm capable of doing so much art for others at huge speeds (commissions) and in that sense I'm super productive (multiple illustrations a day, even if rhey are small). I can easily sit down in the morning and producing art until before bed, but when it comes to my own stuff, it's almost impossible to just sit down and finish projects, be it an artbook, a plot, a comic, a game... I always end falling back into drawing commissions or illustrations, which I can finish with ease.It seems so many gamedevs or comic artists finished projects by the time they were my age or just a bit younger."

I have a waitressing job 4 days a week. The money has fallen to $60/shift in tips plus a paltry $4/hr. It's a daytime waitressing position, as I have the tendency to become extremely unproductive during the day and drink to excess when I'm off at 10pm or later. It's happened countless times.Beyond that, I find it nearly impossible to live with a stranger. The last two roommates I have had that I didn't really know have ended badly. This is why I moved in with my brother and his family."

Tommorow I have an exam in a subject that I was not attending for almost half a semester because being there in lectures is just as useless as just not being there.(Was doing other homework in the meantime though, so suppose it was more useful to not be there in the end).

I would say that 99.999999% of the time people are discouraging you from pursuing new endeavors/career paths because of their own insecurities.

I know you can do this!!,"There's a reason I work the evening shift.

Just remember to enjoy yourself and find your calling. once you find your calling you can use it to direct your education to where you want to go. not sure if this helps but thats my opinion,"I'm struggling right now in many things. I have a bachelor of science in graphic design, but it's a popular career and I'm just not competitive enough. When my old job falsely accused me of assault, I got a certificate in technical writing to boost my chances at a new job. When I learned I might need to somehow move into a senior community to help out a friend, I got a certificate for in-home senior care so I could be his caretaker. Due to the pandemic, many certification classes are extremely cheap. So I picked up a photoshop class to boost my chances of a side job with graphic design even though the degree should technically cover it.Now I seem to have an ""addiction"" to getting more education and certificates. Im not spending $1000s of dollars for a class so its not like I'm ""spending money I don't have""."

"Ok I want to recommend some things: Try taking care of your body. Go eat some food, drink water, take a shower, take your meds. It's important.

And now I dont feel anything is left. She has been distant for a long time now, not texting or answering calls. She only said she has shit going on but nothing more."

I was always active. I put on weight. 100 lbs. I tried to do call centers. Found out that years of emotional abuse had made it so I just sob when customers yell at me. Tried to go back to warehouse work but the pain in my legs, feet, hips and back was excruciating. Only lasted 3 months. Husband was the bread winner and I did literally everything else. All he had to do was bring home a check. I scheduled appointments, paid bills, cleaned the house, planned meals, grocery shopped, etc. I was already doing that while also working. It was nice to only do one side of it. We bought a house. 1 month later my husband lost his job of 7 years. In the 2 years since, he has worked a total of 5 months. We cashed out his 401k. It lasted a year."

He puts me on mute to take the call. I suspect it was a woman. I ask about it. He denies and says it was a friend who called. I refused to accept. He hangs up the phone and I don't hear from him for the rest of the day as he refuses to take my calls. 2 months later he confesses that a girl did call his hotel phone but he didn't do anything with her and he told me later because he felt that situation was a proud moment for him and I should be proud of him as well.&amp;#x200B;Incident 2My grandmother passes away of cancer and I travel to Philadelphia to celebrate her life and home going ceremony.

Be prepared to accept consequences from others that you probably cannot control.,"I am going on a journey of self discovery and Im really scared to open up about something personal that I need to ask.

Best of luck to you man!,"I really need a girl in my life to help me, I have a more sensitive side that I'm showing now that needs to be vented. Ive only kissed or had a relationship with one girl ever and she cheated on me after two weeks. I am such a sincere and open-minded person and girls always turn me down, or claim to really like me a friend ( I'm fine with that) and later avoid me. Finally, I met an adorable girl recently who I connect with so well, but she only wanted to be friends, which I agreed to, yet now she always has a lame excuse to ignore me. I just feel lost and underappreciated"

"Maybe you need more training or schooling; you may not want to accumulate the debt that schooling requires, but in the long term, you could gain skills that allow you to get a job that you love, make you feel more fulfilled, and pay off that debt quicker.I hope the job pursuit at the restaurant was fruitful and that you use it as a stepping stone to something great!","I just made a big post in r/depression about how my life is wasting away.

He's telling me I'm trash, that's why I don't have a ring on my finger, all of my relationships in the future will result in men passing me around because I'm a grimy person. I fall for this trap and lose my shit and get into a verbal altercation with him. What made me really blow a gasket is when he tells me that he gave me another chance and I haven't changed my behavior. I hang up on him.

She's nice, funny, quiet, shy, cute, and from the little bit we've interacted she seems like an interesting person. We haven't interacted much outside of passing conversation because I'm also a pretty quiet and shy person, so the few times I've had the chance I've never been able to think of a way to interact with her without it seeming very forced or making it awkward for one or both of us. The crush level has gone up recently because she got me a cheesecake platter for my birthday. Not an unusual thing as she's always bringing in cookies for everyone but it made my day all the same."
"Way to go man!! That stuff is insanely scary but it's absolutely worth the shot.As for pointers, I dont have many but maybe try something that sounds more casual such as, ""hey, want to get lunch together sometime?"" or ""want to get coffee sometime?",I am asking my crush out tommorow and have a very low self esteem. I am very very scared and anxious. Could use some pointers and such. Thank you random internet people.

Good luck!,"As the title says, I've been wanting to be an EMT for many years of my life but I've always doubted if I could because of a small learning disability that I have.

All you have to do is ask and the worst that can happen is no one has a good answer.,"So. Im a near-first-time cosplayer, and Im not very confident in myself. For reference, Im in middle school (Almost done!), so confidence doesnt necessarily come easily. My sister and her entire friend group cosplay a bunch and sometimes, when I look at their cosplays, I think theyre way better than mine ever could be, even though I know theyre older and more experienced. Im actually in my Tanjiro cosplay right now, and I want to post it to /r/cosplay, but Im really scared someone will diss me because its not good or I dont have contacts or something. This is kind of a stupid problem and pretty light compared to some of the other, heavier stuff on this subreddit."

She wasn't mean about it. She just stated that it was time for her to have her space back. I'm worried that after all the changes I have been making, I'm back where I started.

"Awesome!  Good to celebrate the successes. =DAs an aside, FWIW, my wife (who's a dietician) says that regular meals are important -- the tendency to skip meals is actually counterproductive, even with restricted calories.

You know when only *one* small thing goes wrong then suddenly youre all up in a rut about every life decision youve made? Well, Im feeling really shitty about the fact that technically I allowed two things of my own possession to get slightly damaged, all in one night. Due to being lazy in bed, I asked my dad to shake my lava lamp to let the floating hardened liquid to sink towards the bottom. He shook it too hard, causing the whole thing to fall apart and for the lightbulb to lose one of its connector pieces. He said hed go to the hardware store soon to replace the lightbulb, but Im in slight doubt if the lamp will work after that, feeling that its my fault, in technical aspects."

You're tough as hell and done so much. Not to be platitude-y but it seems like you can do anything you set your mind to!

I don't have periods, never did even when I was smaller. I can probably grow a mustache and beard. The upkeep is frustrating. I have always felt worthless. I was getting gal bladder attacks regularly for 3 years but I thought I was faking it for sympathy. I spent several months trying to get the pain diagnosed. My job fired me for absences, even though I scheduled them and got written permission. Temp manufacturing work. 1 year and a half. Didn't matter. 1 week later I was hospitalized. Almost died.

May you find good friends that truly appreciate you and may you live a prosperous life.","I spent all my days alone, as usual, except this time was no longer spent in silence, sketching the plants and animals nearby, It was spent trying to build a talent. I spent hours and hours of time neglected by others, wripping up scraps of whatever paper i could find, crying for a talent. Something people would love me for, and something i could use to make people want to love me! And at that point,, i had spent so much time focusing on talents and being loved, that i lost my enjoyment. And once i lost my enjoyment,, there was nothing left. But people came to me,, they came to ME!! for art!! It was stunning, until i realized that that's all i was. A source of talent."

I finished my original degree 17 years ago and have worked in IT since then but the past year had really made me fall out of \~\~love\~\~ like with that. I've wanted a masters for a long time with the idea that eventually I'd pursue a new career as a public policy analyst so I've gone back to undergraduate courses in economics and math with the idea if I do well I'll pursue a masters in economics but if not maybe public policy or political science or just go back to work. Of note I'm married with a 6 moth old daughter.Well...I showed up to my first calculus test (I originally passed it with an 89.6 in 2002 but am retaking it to prepare for calculus II) and the teacher told us we couldn't use our calculators and to put them away. We all panic. I didn't even finish the test.

I only seem to reduce my sadness by eating and sometimes doing some sport and school is like a blessing because I can communicate without planning something out that might just not happen again. I'm typing this text because it might help me feel better by finally telling someone about it. I'm sorry for my English because I'm not a native speaker and I'm just writing without really thinking a lot.
"Having other people tell You it's fine and give You their insight on the matter really helps, though try not to overuse it or at least not to vent to the same person all the time, otherwise You will become toxic towards that person as they will have to deal not only with their problems but with Yours too.

Im sorry that I cant really give much advice. I just hope you can find some encouragement knowing that you arent alone in your fears.

When I learned I might need to somehow move into a senior community to help out a friend, I got a certificate for in-home senior care so I could be his caretaker. Due to the pandemic, many certification classes are extremely cheap. So I picked up a photoshop class to boost my chances of a side job with graphic design even though the degree should technically cover it.Now I seem to have an ""addiction"" to getting more education and certificates.

We've been in a relationship for 3 years and I'm feeling down about it and I don't know why. This relationship has been an entire roller coaster from the start. I met my partner in 2016 and things moved very swiftly. So swiftly, that I ended up pregnant. This pregnancy was mutual and we both wanted a long-lasting fruitful relationship, so I thought. I was determined to do better and make this my last relationship but things quickly turned for the worst.Here are some situations:&amp;#x200B;Incident 1\-Boyfriend was in Miami for his birthday since we could not go on our trip to Mexico together. While on his trip he was calling me to stay in touch. I encountered a few incidents where he was inappropriately interacting with women.Encounter 1- I hear a girl ask him ""who'se ass is fatter?"""
Sometimes life doesn't work out the way we wanted it to and it's okay because everything works out the way its supposed to. Take care of yourself and work your hardest to only move up from here on. Maybe getting a GED or finishing your high school credits are the first step.,Now I'm back living in Toronto Ontario Canada and I'm 32 years old.
"Hi there... wow, I can't believe nobody has responded!  But I'll tell you, you are definitely okay.  I hope that the people that should be supporting you will eventually realize how shitty they're being, and start to be a bit more human.  Regardless of them - good for you for striking out on your own!","Hey. 22 year old guy, living in a small town in West Texas. Moved here for my first job outside of college. The job is good, and I have a good group of people out here. But I'm hiding from a lot of people that I'm gay. My closest friends know. My family knows. But the people I'm with day in and day out don't know. So in some ways I'm still in closest there, but what's hurting me the most is those who I'm out to. My friends will just keep making ""fag"" jokes. My family will still keep asking why I haven't found a girl. When I'm going to grow out of ""that phase in college where I dated guys"". I'm tired of being different. I wish I could just love a woman, or be normal... Whatever. I just want someone to tell me I'll be okay. Thanks Internet. "
"Some day, when you're the boss, you'll remember what it was like to be the intern.Without knowing too many of the particulars of your job, it's hard to say what to expect. Be encouraged, my friend! Hang in there, and I'm sure things will turn out all right in the end, u/boxesrcool.","It is now week 3 of my first ever internship and every day I come home feeling worse about myself and how things are going. I try to ask questions but a lot of times I feel like Im so confused I dont know where to start or my manager is not there and i dont even know who to go to for questions. When he is there and I ask questions he always seems to answer in a way that makes me feel stupid and like I should have just figured out the answer on my own. I am currently working on 3 projects and a couple side projects for my managers boss. Not sure if that is normal or not but I am feeling very  overwhelmed and anxious. Im just tired of coming back to my apartment everyday feeling like Ive accomplished nothing again, I am constantly wondering why I was hired for this position when I know so many others that would probably do better.

"I'm cheering for you, and I am inspired by your ability to self reflect and move forward with a plan that you believe is right for you, regardless of the opinions of those who don't believe in you.","Former Dream of Being a Doctor, Now Changed To Nursing. Looking for Encouragement.Just as the title says, I once had the dream of being in medical school, but due to my low gpa, changed my focus to nursing and I was looking for encouragement. Little back story:For my the longest time, I would say since I was like 7 years old, I was driven to become hopefully become a Neurosurgeon, I often would read material, watch surgeries, and do whatever I could to help me better understand not only the role of medicine, but how it affects the lives and the crucial role it played in the lives of millions of people. I attend the University of Alabama at Birmingham. I was offered a scholarship to the university while in middle school. By the time I took the ACT my 8th grade summer, I managed to score an 28. UAB was impressed by this and offered me a scholarship. Fast forward, I graduated high school with a GPA of a 4.42."
Has her food changed since bringing her home? Ours was on crappy shelter food and we had about a week and a half of accidents while she adjusted to new diet. The thing that really helped was getting her some doggy probiotics bc the farts were ridiculous lol. ,"Hey all. My girlfriend and I just adopted a rescue dog (German Sheppard) and brought her home yesterday. The thing is, she is a REALLY tough case and really put us through our paces last night and this morning. We could really just use a little cheerleading to boost us up and keep us going for a minute. We've both had tough dogs before, but it's been a stressful time in general so it is extra tough at the moment. Thanks! &lt;3"
"I certainly dont say this to provide the impression that you should feel better than them because they are actually worse off, but know that they are no better than you because they are skinny, pretty, etc.. They, too, struggle.","I'm 19, I weigh 235 lb I used to be 250 at the beginning of the year, but it's really hard to keep exercising. Just today I was at the gym not 10 minutes ago and a couple of super skinny super hot girls just snickered at me. Part of it's probably because I'm paranoid but I feel like they were saying look at the fat girl trying to be like us Jesus Christ she doesn't f****** belong here. And so I ran home. I don't know if I can keep going to the gym and having those negative experiences. I'm just to anxiety-ridden and depressed to not go to the gym but at the same time when it's making those symptoms worse... I don't know I just need some encouragement."
"hello, fellow Canadian here. Close to Toronto. I can understand how frustrating this is for you and I am sorry you are going through this alone. I am not in a similar position but I am sure there are lots of people in the same position as you.","I'm really scared living in Canada and being poor and mentally ill.I suffer from neurological and mental disorders and have always had trouble keeping work. I'm in an affordable city ( Montreal ) but really want to go, but everywhere I look it all seems even more expensive than it was.Toronto is not doable, Hamilton has gone up a lot too. I could really only afford a shared apartment on minimum wage ( if I could keep the job ) and disability isn't enough for a 1 bedroom either. Living with others can be very stressful, of course not as stressful as being homeless, I know I was once for a short time.I just feel so depressed being poor and mentally ill in Canada, like the raising rent and costs of food, ect makes it no longer a place for poor people, minimum wage workers."
"That must have been so difficult for you. Congratulations for ending that toxic relationship, he didnt deserve you in the first place. Please pm me if you want to talk, vent or just get it all off your chest. Best wishes for you and your son, I hope that life keeps getting better for you both &lt;3","He continues to go on a tirade that I'm pitting the baby against him. He continues to berate me and say anything he can think of, stating that I'm just like every other bitch that tries to keep him from being a good man. At the time I'm 8 months pregnant.&amp;#x200B;Incident 5I was traveling to work when my tire went flat. I had to pull over in a parking lot because it was too dangerous to continue to drive. At the time, my car did not have AC and I had my son in the backseat taking him to daycare. I call my partner to inform him that I needed his help because my car was disabled. He asked me to drop a pin at my location and I did but it gave the incorrect address, so I gave him the actual address of where I was. Instead of coming to get me, he started to rant about not wanting to be on the road searching for me."
"You nailed the thought there.  That doubt is self-sabotage.  I agree with the other commenters: go the extra-thoughtful mile, and don't worry.  You have no control over how she'll receive the gift, so just do your best and be yourself.  (And besides, if she's into you then she'll appreciate you being authentic anyway!  Honesty is the only foundation for a solid relationship, my dude.)  Go get her. =)","Putting aside the anxiety I'm feeling about just giving them to her, I'm utterly *terrified* she's going to think this is some kind of assholish passive-aggressive one-upmanship because I'm making the cannoli rather than buying it like she did with the cheesecake."
"I think you're heading in the right direction. You may think that none of these things go together. My niece just finished her master's in engineering, she's going to be building and maintaining bridges.","As I said, most of these classesare on sale due to schools trying to help either people who were laid off find new skills or people who are in quarantine find new hobbies, and they are usually between $10 and $25 each depending on the class.I ended up picking up classes to get certified in copywriting, dog training, and digital photography on top of what I mentioned above. I'm starting to regret picking up these new skills- like it feels like I'm trying to compensate or fill a void now.Am I biting off more than I can chew here? Am I doing too much? Is there such a thing as too much learning? Should I stop? I could just use a little direction and confirmation that this choice to learn more will not end up disappointing me in the future."
"Hang in there, dude. Praying for you and I believe in you. Peace be with your mind, in Jesus name. You are loved.","I tend to have a very small circle of friends these two in particular are a couple that I had spent nearly half my days with for the past couple years. I felt a deep bond between us.They read my proposal, and their reaction was basically holy shit. We sat there talking about the possibilities for an hour straight.I got overwhelmed and needed to cool off in their bathroom. I was looking at myself in the mirror, and I could feel my brain pulsating and *moving*, like it was rewiring so rapidly that it was causing a physical sensation. Ive never felt anything like it.I suddenly felt enormous guilt. It was as if the universe was angry with me. I had opened Pandoras Box. I was this underaccomplished loser that barely achieved anything noteworthy in my life, always felt like a disappointment to my family, and here I had just stumbled across something that could change the world."
"It's what it's there for, and anyone you talk to would for sure have better advice than I would. If you're looking for unconditional love, all I can say is that the only unconditional love I've ever found came from Jesus. Best decision I ever made was to accept it.","We could all be happy together. I would treat her daughter like she was my own, because she was part of her mother and I loved her mother completely. She said she was headed that direction with me too, and I felt like that was a yes to my question.I am not doing good right now, I am off my med schedule for days now, not eating, not sleeping, and drinking to much. All bad things for me. I am so tired, I wish I could just sleep and not see her there, not see our time together, not spend time at the park playing on the equipment with her daughter. Not holding her in my arms. Not kissing her, not being in love."
"I'm sorry for the troubles you're going thru, on top of being sick, man, that sucks, so i feel you. People just want empathy. Your friend as well as you, as well as me and everyone else.","Hi, I'm pretty new here on Reddit. Anyway, I've been really sick for about a week now. Because of it, I've mostly been staying at home.My best friend regularly texts me from school and cheers me up. We have a really great relationship and almost never argue with each other)But today, she texted me out of nowhere, saying that ""I wish I were in your place"", and kept talking about how I had it easy and how stressed she was, unlike me.I was honestly really surprised, considering she knew how bad the pains from my illness are. I told her that my position is not perfect either and that I didn't wish her the pain I had."
"Far out, even by themselves each one is really hard to deal with.  I honestly would fall apart really quickly in that situation.  I think you'll look back on this time and hopefully be proud of how you handle it and what decisions you make.  I'm rooting for you, you got this!","Hey everyone,I am feeling really overwhelmed, and I wasn't sure where else to turn. My long-term boyfriend left me a few days ago completely unexpectedly, the day before Thanksgiving. We share a house, a dog and two cats. I wouldn't have committed to all of those things if I didn't think he was in it for the long haul. We just renewed our least last month.I have finals for grad school this weekend and next. It's a really hard program that I'm struggling with right now. I need to get an A on one of my finals or I will get kicked out (the program requires above an 85 in all classes and I did really poorly on the midterm).I haven't had time to study. I am so stressed. I can't afford the house on my own, so I have been scrambling for an apartment. I think I found one that I can move to next Monday."
"I'm sorry you feel that way. I'm actually a teacher! You dont have to let school make you sad, do your best and that's all you can ask of yourself. Some people are beyond the strict scheduling, expectations and whatnot. SCHOOL IS NOT FOR EVERYONE. That doesnt make you stupid or anything. But you need to finish cause your life will be way easier with a diploma. But never let it make you feel like you cant do anything. 3 years to go!","I wake up at 6:00 AM only to go to a Place where I'll never feel like I'm good enough at anything. Every time I tell people this they just say ""Well you have to go to school So to bad,"". Any encouragement would be good."
"Off-road vehicles are risky, and children under age 15 make up an unsettlingly high proportion of those severely injured or killed.Kids already get injured more than enough, even without adults pressuring them to engage in dangerous activities. There are plenty of great hobbies suitable for your brother at his current age that he will enjoy just as much or even more with far less risk.I have a friend who is a doctor.","I'm trying to help my little brother and if this isn't allowed mods you can remove it. My little brother(technically brother in law) started riding his dirt bike in May. He loved it, we were out there with head lights some nights. When he wasn't riding he was watching videos on how to get better. Then at the end of June he went down hard and fractured his arm. While he was in his cast he was itching to get riding again and when he finally got the chance to he was on his bike within an hour of being given the ok. A few hours later he went down hard again. He escaped with a bruise, nothing broken."
"You might think there is so much more importent thing in the world but to you, you, yourself is and the only thing importent. You meant to whole world to you and one day you will be the world to someone else too.","I just want to lay in bed all day and relax, nap, and cry a little. I apologize if this post is too ""complain-y"" and I know there are much more important things in the world than me being tired of being sick. I am so thankful that I can do school from home and not have to go out for work, especially with the pandemic going on. I am also thankful that my symptoms are not as bad as many people right now, but I am also really scared that this might lowkey be covid and the symptoms will ramp up. I could just use some encouragement right now."
"If youre still in high school, a school counselor or resource officer might help.Just know that this wont last forever.","Literally, the only thing that is keeping me together at this point is the internet. People encourage others and make people laugh, even though you don't know them. Under all the craziness of school drama and life, I can still find some good online. Anyway, I just need some tips on how to get my dad's words out of my head, or at least a link to a funny meme to cheer me up or something. I just need to stop overthinking all the stuff he yells at me for. I'm not good at explaining stuff, so can you just throw some comments at me? It seems like I'm just asking for attention, and now that I think of it, I probably am. I don't get any in real life, so let's just see if some random people online care!:)  why did i write this"

To keep things short and sweet, they lacked both social and managerial skills needed for said job and honestly just doesn't know how to treat human beings. So i left, mid shift, and never came back.

There are only a few places left that are affordable for low income people in Canada, and those places have high unemployment and are car dependent. I guess I wish I knew someone who was struggling financially and mentally ill, I'm so alone and scared in my own country.TLDR:I'm really scared living in Canada and being poor and mentally ill with the high rent, car dependent cities, and Covid affecting the economy."

The important thing is deciding how to respond to it.Sorry if my words weren't magic, but I hope you know they are at least sincere. Be well.","Returning to school after ~10 years feels weird. Its a struggle, in fact. I went in feeling confident, but... something is wrong. Scored 95% and 92% on the first two exams of my most challenging class, but basically flunked everything else in my other classes.Part of me just... died. I feel like I peeked behind the curtain and cant return to reality in the same way. I can barely take care of myself. I dont *want* to take care of myself. And its not as if a dark half of myself is whispering these things, trying to take over. I feel as though all of me is ready to die.Since I left my job, no more quality health insurance. I only have access to basic services."

When I put my identity , of who I am in something permanent thats when there is no fear of losing peace, thats when I have nothing to be anxious of. Doesnt it answer our fundamental question. We lose so much of our lives in giving and focusing on temporary needs and dont realise the grave danger of losing out on hope. I found the answer in this Covid 19 situation and somehow Im grateful that I realised it. Im regaining my peace during the madness around me and I want to leave you with this exhortation to shift your identity to Jesus.

Take that as much needed R&amp;R",For 4 years I have been dating a high functioning autistic woman.(30) She lived with her parents for the entire duration. Recently her father quit his job because he couldnt take a vacation the days he wanted to.Within 3 days of hearing this story I was informed they would be moving across the state and that she would be going with them. Note at this time we had plans for marriage and had a great relationship.Today she ended our relationship. Her reasons where not her own they were the exact parrotings of her parents far right wing conservatives note that I am not white or conservative. We never let this affect anything or even talk about it. 3 months ago I had open heart surgery at 29.
"I hear parenthood refocuses a person's priorities and perspective on life. The realization that a new human being -- their well-being, education, role-models, their entire future!-- depends on you *should* be a life-changing experience. Unfortunately, many parents seem unable to put their children first.","So I go into survival mode and wind back upstairs. During this time from Wednesday to Sunday, I am uncomfortable and nervous. I am under the impression that I''m allowed to leave by myself but not with my son. He finally agrees that the hurricane is no longer a threat and that I could go home. I did allow him to see my son, and try to co-parent like he wished but after picking up my son on Tuesday morning and experiencing how my partner was still being aggressive with me, I finally realized how my emotional and physical safety was at risk.I called the police and reported the domestic dispute and he was eventually arrested and forced to do anger management.&amp;#x200B;After everything had happened, I decided to reconnect with him and try again.

I entered the house as long as he was away from me. As soon as I entered the house, he started verbally attacking me. I start to defend myself and continue to let him know that he was out of line. Did I say what I needed to nicely? I didn't. What he was dishing to me, I gave it back to him. He wanted me to stop talking and when I refused to not be heard after he insulted me, he started choking me several times in front of his mother, sister, 8 year old nephew, and my 7 month old infant son."

Everyday is different with her mood (she isn't diagnosed with anything that I know of) for example: if I hang out most of the day with my bf, her mood is a flip of a coin once I arrive. If I hang out too often then she flips out on me. I'm afraid of moving out because I don't know the outcome of what will happen which ik won't be good.

On top of that, her mental health has been beyond terrible for herwhich is likely a huge driving force for the dependencyand Ive gotten Caregivers Fatigue 3 or 4 times already. I desperately want to communicate this issue but she can already read it off of me (been together for a long time) which is making her mental health worse at times, and I think if we were to outright have that conversation it would cause her mental health to be even worse. She also gets upset that it seems like I view her as helpless and unable to function without me, and admittedly I do because shes so extremely needyI hate myself physically. Literally from my head to my toes: I cant find a good haircut and the barber that I helped out with that couldnt be consistent, then COVID hit and Im out a barber & reference point for my hair."

And now I'm on medication with a side effect of insomnia. My current situation is unsustainable, and these early classes will allow me to stick with my usual evening shift; but I have a long history of being easily discouraged and can already feel myself backpedaling.

A few months ago on I was promoted to my first management position. I was so excited to be In leadership and I really thought I could make a difference in someone's career. About 2 months ago I got my team, all new hires, and almost all straight out of  college with little or no job experience. They are so rough. After rigorous training almost all of them are rough, to be expected of course.What I wasnt expecting is to have 4 HR issues right of the bat and them escalating me to leadership above me. I have 3 that are are written warnings for attendance, 1 more and will be termed. 1 went to my leadership and asked if I was right. Unfortently I so know this may happen as people might be unhappy, especially if they are having performance issues. All day my leaders tell me that i have such a bad team and they feel so bad for me, that I'm doing great handling it and it's really breaking me in."

Not what I dreamed of or anywhere near it and I'm not getting those jobs either, they keep asking for experience and a high school diploma. Even the fast food joints are doing that, which I think is stupid. What experience does someone need in order to ask the question ""do you want fries with that?""

I know that I need to suck it up and suffer through. I know that I should eat eggs for every meal and canned tuna and lose the weight by sheer determination. I know that the pain in my hips and ankles is nothing and I should just walk through it. I know I should take a job and just grind it out every day. But when I think about the pain of that, I feel like giving up and dying. I just don't think that I can do it, or this anymore. I have plans to see a therapist. I have to ramp up to it. I make a bunch of calls and then I am burnt out and have to ramp up to it again. And yes, I know. I should just suck it up and call."

For the sounds of nursing on paper it checks every box. Ive shadowed a lot of nurses and genuinely love the interactions and meaning behind being a nurse and the role they play. So maybe after a couple years of becoming a nurse, work on getting my CCRN and pursing my interest in CRNA or just seeing where I go. So what are your thoughts right now?:In my mind everything is plays out perfectly but in reality, I first have to get accepted to nursing school. However, nursing school is competitive and being from a disadvantage background there are days that i feel like Im not doing anything right. For every one step forward I fall two steps behind."

My legs and arms were cuffed to a bed for the entire night. They position you in a certain uncomfortable position so you cant reach your hands close enough together to grab/use anything.

It felt like I was in that hospital for 300 years. I eventually calmed down enough that they actually approved to release me. At first, I wanted to voluntarily commit myself somewhere, so they began the process of finding a location with availability.

That others have problems just like me, often times worse. This year has been such a rollercoaster ride of hurt feelings, destroyed dreams, and missed opportunities. I found out this year that Im bi. And now Im in a relationship with another guy. My family (heavily Baptist) havent found out and I dont plan on telling them for as long as possible. Same story for my bf only worse. I worry for him, what if they find out? What if it ends? The US is now a flawed democracy and the only thing we have to look forward to is a ffffffucking civil war. My minds full of doubt all the time telling me that I wont be good enough."

Now Ive been back at it for 2 months, and I feel like everything Ive worked for over many many years has gone out the window. Im doubting everything, I feel like I dont know what Im doing and I ruined my chances of succeeding. Things shouldnt be this bad after 2 months back at it, and Im embarrassing myself around my colleagues.  Ive never seriously considered giving up on this career path until now. I feel like Ive been trying so hard and for so long that this stupid surgery setting me back like this is too much to handle. Some words of wisdom or encouragement would really help me right now. Im struggling to see how this can possibly be made right."
You got this! Itll make you feel much better and relieved I would think.,"Im about to tell my partner Im bisexual.

"You are right about the current state of the systems here in Canada, the minimum wage workers can not afford to live and this entire country is car dependent. And yes Covid is reeking havoc on mental health all over the world.","I'm just alone in this big city, no license, no job, and the Covid19 situation makes it hard for me to connect to communities, to feel like I have a future. There are only a few places left that are affordable for low income people in Canada, and those places have high unemployment and are car dependent. I guess I wish I knew someone who was struggling financially and mentally ill, I'm so alone and scared in my own country."

"Must love and well wishes, best of luck in this new part of your living, consider yourself lucky to be able to have that independence in a time when even adults who once had it have found themselves return home or return to living with roommates or any of a number of things, everyone has their own story and it's great to know you are able to take the steps now to begin yours with respect to moving out and into your own places/w roommates. Sometimes in time when we think we would like people the most or wish people were around for xyz we find the strength of being able to be with one self and live in acceptance and self love and mindfulness.","I just finished packing my car by myself! I know its just a small part of moving but I dont know where else to go for encouragement with the little stuff.

"I am at the one place that I felt loved in my entire life. A 3 year old showed me love and acceptance that day, it was also the day that her mother started distancing from me. I dont know why, never will. The most happy day in my life and it will never happen again. I won't have that life that I had for that day.","We could all be happy together. I would treat her daughter like she was my own, because she was part of her mother and I loved her mother completely.

Not holding her in my arms. Not kissing her, not being in love."

I just don't know how possible that is, or even if it's possible at all. I had so many dreams as a kid of things I wanted to be when I grew up. When I was very young I wanted to be President Of The United States (I didn't know that as a kid born in Canada that one had to be born in U.S.A to be the President but I was a young kid.)

They've been replaced by activities like hiking and meditation - its fun, but it's not what I really want. I come from a big family. We must update each other every week on how we have been. Negative points if you don't make the weekly Skype. Even more negative if you dont 'bring it'and show how you are 'crushing Covid.'I'm so tired. I have about 10% gas left in my tank.

I just need some help and seeing if I officially meet the requirements and seeing what I need to do. Why nursing?:As I mentioned before my passion and my driven mood is in the medical field. One of the most remunerating parts of a role in nursing is the capacity to associate with our patients on such a close level. While we frequently meet under exceptionally troublesome conditionsbeing available as individuals face genuine wellbeing difficulties or wounds, seeing the snapshot of birth or the finish of lifewe become more acquainted with our patients rapidly and have the chance to assume a significant function in their lives. I turned into an attendant so I could affect the lives of others and have a role that felt important.Why not dental, pharmacy, or any other career?I have looked into each of these careers and more but my whole academic career was based around being a medical school student.

They come in with a negative attitude and it sucks the life out of me to be positive for them and the rest of my team. The hard part is the need to treat them as though I dont hate them and still provide great management and fairness.

My best friend is an amazing person. She has a heart bigger then mine and mine is the size of texas. She made a bad choice in a weak moment. So i would ask again were they really your friends? The girl... that wasnt right.,The subject of our relationship status got brought up again and she said she was conflicted and part of her wants to just remain friends and part of her wants something more. I asked her if we could talk about it in person but we had to end up FaceTiming. It turns out all that flirting and leading on was her intentionally doing that to see if she was interested. What I took as affection turned out to be experimentation and at this point she was trying to avoid telling me the truth. Ive been rejected before but this one was different. She was leading me on for a month and a half and I thought I was really getting somewhere. The fact that she tried to feel that way for me and couldnt made everything worse. I know this may sound irrational but I cant help feel that there is something wrong with me and that Im screwed up and thats why this happened to me. Every time I put myself out there I get hurt and this one was a huge blow to the gut.

We had such a great time together, laughing, making out, and just holding each other.We talked about the future, what we wanted to do together, places to visit, things to do, how our live would be together."

a wise man once said its better to have a job you love with a low salary than a terrible high paying job. perhaps this isn't right for you!,"I'm feeling really low. A few months ago on I was promoted to my first management position. I was so excited to be In leadership and I really thought I could make a difference in someone's career. About 2 months ago I got my team, all new hires, and almost all straight out of  college with little or no job experience. They are so rough. After rigorous training almost all of them are rough, to be expected of course.What I wasnt expecting is to have 4 HR issues right of the bat and them escalating me to leadership above me. I have 3 that are are written warnings for attendance, 1 more and will be termed. 1 went to my leadership and asked if I was right. Unfortently I so know this may happen as people might be unhappy, especially if they are having performance issues. All day my leaders tell me that i have such a bad team and they feel so bad for me, that I'm doing great handling it and it's really breaking me in."

"I used to be one and would sit with any woman filing for an intervention order against a partner that wanted me to, and I would sit in a way that meant they didnt have to look at the person or see their face, (there were support workers for men filing for orders too) bring a photo of a loved one or memory that makes you smile and whilst theyre saying their piece you can have a moment and take your mind somewhere else by looking at the photo, also remember 5-5-5 breathing if you get anxious, breath in for 5 counts, hold it for 5 counts, exhale for 5 counts.","Just need a little encouragement.

It does sound to me like this would be a perfect conversation to have with a licensed counselor and I really encourage you to consider doing that first. Use time with a counselor to work on any worries you might have about others opinions of you. Work through this first and so many things can fall into place afterwards. Dont want a counselor?,"Please just encourage me to begin this self discovery and take the steps I need to help myself figure out who I am truly.

I would just accept that gracefully and not pay any more attention to it.If youre a reader, you can check out *The New Abs Diet* by David Zinczenko.

I found it really helpful.","So Im not that chubby, I just have a little flab on my stomach that I want to get rid of. The way Im trying to lose it is by counting the calories of what I eat, and trying to eat a minimum of 1,200 calories per day.

Part of it's probably because I'm paranoid but I feel like they were saying look at the fat girl trying to be like us Jesus Christ she doesn't f****** belong here. And so I ran home. I don't know if I can keep going to the gym and having those negative experiences.

Youre gonna do great!,I'm filming my first commercial for the red Cross today and I'm really nervous. I just need some encouragement.
"You still have Monday and Tuesday to study!  Trust me friend you've got this, and I've been there before, use your time wisely, make sure you eat well, make sure you spend a couple of minutes outside for a break or breath of fresh air.  You've got this!!",Can I get some words of encouragement please? I have an exam on Tuesday that I barely studied for maybe a maximum of 1 hour I've studied for it and I just need some encouragement some words that will get my ass up to my computer and to my books so I can go study
"&gt; Subsequent to arrival at the boxing ring, dressing up in the trimmings of a clown will get you so far. Itll take confident gusto to menace your foe and meet the expectations that Christ considers. Firstly, false righteousness is perhaps the most eye-piercing of all inwardly held weaknesses.","Also, keeps looking at me.4.ect.....But I get dumb in my brain sometimes cause anxiety and depression.....Like I'm pretty sure that all I have to do is be ""Hey grrrr, What up?"" but I don't because reasons.Maybe words of encouragement from Rando Calrissian might help me get over myself and be like ""Grrrrr, What up?""Edit: we had coffee and a walk around big lots earlier today. She was all serotonin deprived so I felt like timing was awful. But we have plans to make candles on Tuesday. I really feel that this might be something. Edit: thank you guys( and girls) I know everything I needed was in me but sometimes you just need some random mofo to be like ""do that shit""."
"In the meantime, I'm sure your family is so happy to have a guy like you in it.You are prepared to capitalize on opportunities that come your way. You are doing the things in your control, even though you haven't seen results yet.","It's just really discouraging and I am losing all of my confidence, and maybe I thought reddit would have nice things to say to help cheer me up a little. Maybe this is the right subreddit for that."
But like I didn't have time to sit there to re-organize my thoughts ofc. So I just went with my instincts and got the procedures correctly. So I suggest you to just practice more and be attentive. Don't panic too much.,"Hey, 18 F here. I have pretty bad anxiety and i finally got the courage to schedule my driver's test a few weeks ago. I studied my heart out, took 11 pages of notes on the driver's manual, and i thought i was ready. But I missed a stop sign and that's an automatic failure. I never even saw the damn thing because there was a tree branch in the way, and ended up missing a second one because I sort of went into a panicked state and shut down. When I parked and the lady told me a failed, i started bawling and I ended up crying all the way home and for a few hours after that."
"Yes, remove any toxic people from your life. It may be hard, but do it, and do it ASAP, or it's just going to get harder to do it the longer you wait. Trust me, it'll be one for the best decisions that you make in life.",I need a pick me up. I've been getting a few comments that don't sit well with me. Should I just remove those people from my life to avoid further toxicity?
"I believe in you :)Calc is hard! I failed it then dropped out of uni LOLBut it wasn't for me and I found a new path that led me to graduate top 5 in my class.Anyways, you got this!!! and if you don't. I am here to help :)&amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;The Doc","Hey everyone, hope you're doing well in these trying times.I'm just really upset because I have a 58 in my calc midterm. I'm trying to go to university and I can't help but feel really discouraged at how poorly I'm doing. I spent my whole life grinding academically for this moment and I'm choking really hard. Would really appreciate it if someone could believe in me, because I'm spiralling and I'm so anxious all the time about not being able to go to an accredited program. Thanks for your time :)"
Sometimes life doesn't work out the way we wanted it to and it's okay because everything works out the way its supposed to. Take care of yourself and work your hardest to only move up from here on. Maybe getting a GED or finishing your high school credits are the first step.,I've always dreamed about living on my own and being independent with a career that I love.
Youll still be able to stay connected to Mike via phone/txt. You should try to get some help from teachers or other students for your schoolwork. You only have a couple of years left for high school to be over. Your Mom is probably upset with you because she is disappointed.,And on top of that my mom kicks me out of the house for 4 hours and I don't have a car so I get to bike in a rainstorm and when I'm finally allowed back in she tells me that I need to fuck off and stop being bad at school. It feels like my life is over and that I'm falling under and that I'm trapped if you have anything to say I'm all ears
Self-image is a struggle for most people from time to time and is completely normal.,"Hey guys. So Ive been struggling a lot with self-esteem when it comes to my looks. Ive had the same haircut since like 4th grade  (10th grade now) and get teased about it. About a month ago I tried something new, only to be made fun of for that. I ended up reverting back to my old hairstyle. Today i got a haircut (just shortened my hair, didnt change the style) and, once again I was made fun of, even by an adult coworker. I have acne pretty bad, and regardless of what I try its just inexorable."
Always keep believing; the good in you will triumph.,"I know that I can't work any more than 4 days a week with my current class load and my mental health issues. I can't get treatment now because I can't afford to pay for it. And I'd be lying if I didn't say I feel like the rug has been pulled from out beneath me. Maybe they thought I was doing better than I was actually doing. The truth is that talking about my illness stresses out my SIL. My brother offered to listen but every time I try to talk to him he just walks away. So I've only been telling them good things. Acting positive. Being positive about my job even though it's gotten dire.I'm just angry, sad and lost. I don't have any friends here."
"In my personal opinion, math can be a difficult subject, but if one continually practices and studies it, that person will be able to understand it. That said, I believe you can be smart in your math skills.You can do it my friend. I believe in you.","Sorry for formatting or mistakes, im on my phone and currently crying in the bathroom over first year university calculus, i opened up a ""quiz"" (can be tried as many times until we've gotten over 75% to unlock the current weeks videos) and i just exited out because the first question had me stumped. I havent done the homework yet, and I know that this isn't the way to go, i should havd done homework first to guage how well i know the material before stressing. But I've had this mental block all day, and just this mental block in general that I can't actually be confident in my math skills. And i always have this self doubt. I just have thus idea that I can never be smart in all things math, I'm trying to have a growth mindset but its so hard."
"Hey friend, Im sorry you have to deal with this. I hope it gets better. I hope youre able to get that next job and I hope youre able to feel healthy again.I should really be thanking you for all the work you do in this trying time. Youve helped a lot of people and youve been really brave when working with this. I respect that and I am grateful for that",If not i may need to do travel nursing. I have gained so much weight from school and from working nights. I am so exhausted (I am in grad school FT now and am working) and don't run and work out like i should. My new job will be better and I'll be able to workout more. I am not as attractive and thin as I used to be and I can tell by the way guys are around me then vs now. It's depressing. I've always struggled with weight. Things are tough and i know they will get better. It's life. I could use some encouragement though.
"You've said exercise is important to you. Go for walks, if you can do so safely. Do some at home, YouTube workouts. Drink some water. Clean the house. A neat living space makes a real difference in mood. Most importantly, be kind to yourself.",But Atm i am struggling with self care and my own self worth. Please say something nice to me?
"Speaking to a psychotherapist about intimacy might be a valuable thing to do. Do you feel smothered and suffocated by committment? Do you have addictive or compulsive sexual tendencies? Do you feel guilty turning women down? Do you engage in substance use that increases impulsivity and lowers inhibition? Are you playing out an identification with a mother or father figure who cheated? Or are you trying to reclaim your power from a situation, sexual or not, that robbed you of it? The list of possible contributing factors could go on, but the right therapist will help you clarify and strengthen, without judging you.","Guys, I met a wonderful lady and Im scared that Im gonna ruin it. All my previous relationships I have cheated in some way. Im legit scared Im going to live like this forever. Any tips on how to break that cycle? I have an addiction to women I guess; I see others so happy and moving forward i envy it. Im 26 no real girlfriend yet, time is against me in a rapid way. I just saw a 21 year old get engaged... Im scared Im getting old and not graining up."
"Unfortunately, in these situations it is generally the case (I find) that some initiative on my part may have improved the situation, such that perhaps I shouldnt cut ties like that. It feels good to stick it to em, but you technically only hurt yourself.","This job lasted just short of year an a half when I found out I would be let go under the new buyers of the hospital due to changing certification standards. Mind you I hated this job so this wasn't a bad thing, I was excited. I immediately hoped on indeed and applied for a position at Super Supplements just to get a job. I do enjoy health and wellness so why not? I'm also getting my NASM Personal training certificate and could use an easy side job. I initially started this job April of this year and at first it was incredibly easy being back in retail. Then due to a series of events it got incredibly difficult. No working registers for 4 months, no support from managers, and co-workers who didn't like me. Slowly but surely I realized that it was taking time away from my goals when the whole reason I took the job was to put my goals first."
"I'm so sorry you're going through all of this! I'm not sure of the military process but don't give up hope! Even if this doesn't work out just know that this moment and situation is not forever. It can be tough to see the light at the end, but your light will come! I'm not here to judge you on your decisions or actions because we have all made mistakes or bad decisions. It's tough to face a difficult situation but this makes you stronger and you will get through this. ","They think I didnt ship due to a stomach ache. Theyre livid with me. Yelling at me daily. I know theyre extremely upset. I went and got a full time job so Im not sitting on my bum while all this gets sorted out. But now Im lying to them: saying that I have a ship date for July. When really, I dont. I talked to other recruiters, AF and Marines and theyre encouraging saying as soon as I get my discharge letter they can process me. I need to get out of my home as soon as possible. Forget college at this point. My mother and I actually had the start of a fist fight the other day."
"Love, it hurts! You are making hard choices for a better future! You can stay strong, and keep trying! ","I try to get him to participate but all he said to me was ""I do it when I feel like it"" and continues to act childish, so I give up and wait for people to return to the common area.When we're on our way home, he conveniently starts talking to me telling me how he wants to catch the baby and I ignore him. He doesn't like the fact that I didn't respond to his request so he starts berating me saying, ""that's why all black women are single mothers, because all of you are dysfuctional, you're dysfunctional."" I snap and tell him that ""he was a bitch for the way acted at the birthing center."" Then he mushes me in the head, and I told him to stop touching me, and then he says to me ""what are you going to do about it?"" I responded that I will tell a family member about what he is doing."
"Think about your answer for the strengths/weaknesses question that's usually asked. For example: (strength) I can be productive by myself, but I also work well with others.(Weakness) sometimes I get nervous but I work through it.","Im 16 and applied for a job and got an interview, originally scheduled for next week... turns out they messed up in the email and now my interview is today at 12:30. I have very little time to prepare myself and need words of encouragement."
"Review the material, do the homework then take the test. Dont be stressed the first question stumped you! Youve just got to give yourself the time to learn, and try your hardest to kick the self doubt. Youre amazing, and that will reflect on your grades once you realize you are!","Sorry for formatting or mistakes, im on my phone and currently crying in the bathroom over first year university calculus, i opened up a ""quiz"" (can be tried as many times until we've gotten over 75% to unlock the current weeks videos) and i just exited out because the first question had me stumped.

"And that's absolutely alright. Self care is going to feel difficult, I absolutely understand that. Everything feels bleak right now, but it won't feel that way forever. None of this is going to be forever.","Ive been on a downward spiralMy fianc and I have moved in together at the start of 2020, which either highlighted or exposed some major dependency issues that she has. On top of that, her mental health has been beyond terrible for herwhich is likely a huge driving force for the dependencyand Ive gotten Caregivers Fatigue 3 or 4 times already. I desperately want to communicate this issue but she can already read it off of me (been together for a long time) which is making her mental health worse at times, and I think if we were to outright have that conversation it would cause her mental health to be even worse. She also gets upset that it seems like I view her as helpless and unable to function without me, and admittedly I do because shes so extremely needyI hate myself physically. Literally from my head to my toes: I cant find a good haircut and the barber that I helped out with that couldnt be consistent, then COVID hit and Im out a barber &amp; reference point for my hair."
So how you doing OP?,"Right now Im sitting in my dark and empty house and I dont know if I can do this thing called life. Ive been battling this demon for years now. No one knows whats really going on with me. Ive tried to talk to people about it but they all have the same carbon copied answers - Youre gonna be okay. Itll get better soon. Im sorry youre going through this. I dont think I will though. I know I need to talk this out with a professional, but I cant afford that or the insurance to cover it. Its cruel how the world keeps on going after your own world lies in ashes at your feet. Tbh, I feel empty inside."
We always printed the links in the program so the audience could listen later. Sometimes their work was so good that we would play it as house music before the show started and at intermission.Please do share with us. I would absolutely tell you all the things I like.,"Hello, it's been a long-time secret hobby of mine to record myself playing instruments for fun, but i never had the guts to share my small projects with anyone close to me. Not a single soul. The thought itself is nerve-wracking for me.Early this year, I created a YT channel where I can start first by making covers before posting my own-----except that I am still too nervous to share it with others. There are a few views but from strangers, so it makes me less anxious that people do not know it is me. Just now, I did try sharing it with a few friends, who are still yet to respond."
"Hey Tunapower. Sorry to hear things are feeling so stressful. It can be really hard to see past the current debris in those kinds of situations. Its important to let yourself express your emotions and your feelings, whether with someone or alone.","I'm short of time and even shorter on motivation and willingness to live. I have no other income than my savings and I'm living with my parents. I also have to spend ALL the fucking day alone, working on my thesis and taking care of myself.I just don't know what to do anymore and it is only making me more anxious and overwhelmed. If maybe some of you could give me some advice or encouraging words, that would be great!Thank you so much for reading."
"When you find yourself in these situations try to pop into an observer mode. Imagine a four foot wall of jello around you. When people throw their doubts or other negative emotions and energies at you, walk up to the wall and look at what they have thrown at you and as yourself two questions.","I have a shitty job and a very unsupportive family. While having dinner, I told them about my plans to leave my full time job and build my own career on freelancing. Not even a minute in my explanation and theyve already bombarded me with a lot of questions and doubt. I know freelancing is hard like really really hard but its something that makes me happy (I currently have a part time job which is essentially what Ill be doing as a freelancer) and I know starting from the very beginning will be extremely hard but Im mentally prepared for it. Ive also saved enough money to live for a year which Im confident that Ill be able to get clients by then. It just hurts to know that none of the people I consider the closest to me support me in what I want to do. Its seriously taking a toll to my mental health."
"It must seem like you're constantly taking a sub-optimal direction, sometimes, but on the other hand, consider how far you've come. And this is just from what you've said in four paragraphs:1) Brand new job with (presumably) less-abusive boss. Check.2) You're married to someone you love.",I just quit a job I loved and I've started at my new place. They're really different but my old boss was abusive and careless to his employees and I couldn't take it anymore. I went back to a place I had worked before and I also love it for different reasons. I'm 28 and I haven't found a solid career. My new job has offered to pay for classes to get my LTP as I work at a tax firm. It's really tempting because I would get to stay here with people I love and the pay would be great but my old job was working with kids which i love more. I want to continue working with kids but I would need to go back to school to have jobs that pay enough.I have anxiety and all of this change and stress has been getting to me.
We went to her grandma's house to make candles the other night.  It feels like it could really turn into something...,"I feel like I've been getting positive vibes.1.

Wake up in her bed and she makes me breakfast.)3. Is hosting this Karaoke and invites me, of course I come.  Hugs me more than normal people hug (I'm a hugger and its more than I would do.) Also, keeps looking at me.4.ect.....But I get dumb in my brain sometimes cause anxiety and depression.....Like I'm pretty sure that all I have to do is be ""Hey grrrr, What up?"" but I don't because reasons.Maybe words of encouragement from Rando Calrissian might help me get over myself and be like ""Grrrrr, What up?"""
"Breathe. Take a nice, long, calming breath, maybe take a walk. Talk to your Aunt; start with something small or relatively less private and see how she reacts. If that goes well, continue to talk. Explain that you just need a break, that you feel like shit.","it got to the point where I was terrified to go into work and all they told me was to just leave him alone. so I quit. every time something good happens 10 bad things happen. I wrecked my car and I have a rental car now, but whatever money the insurance gives me my dad is just gonna use to pay off the car that I wrecked. so getting a new car is on me and I have no money. no job. im getting really fucking tired of this shit. all my friends do drugs so I pretty much lost all of them when I got out of rehab. ive stayed clean for the most part, ive only drank and smoked weed a handful of times. i has a job interview today but I couldnt go because I didnt have enough gas in my car. i just want a fucking break."
"If that means getting up early to do a hobby before work, or read a book at night, or something that you enjoy, just try to do that for you. You have value too, I promise.","I made an appointment at a behavioral health place nearby, but my first impression was not good. I want to be honest when I go in to seek their help, so I imagine whoever is tasked with speaking to me will find that helping me will be a challenge. I dont want to play nice. This is serious. Ive had a therapist for years, someone who I deeply trust and believe in. But I think not even someone of her caliber can help me now.I dont know what to expect from an online community like this. I dont know what to ask for. What are the magic words to dispel this curse? Should I keep busy or take a break from everything? Thanks in advance if you care to try."
"And if you notice the little things that light a flame of interest or joy, and follow them like a firefly in a summer night, they will lead you to answers. Be on the lookout for them.","I tried another call center. Cried so they let me go. We don't have the money for food, but Im trying to eat right and exercise anyways. Husband refuses to work. He won't clean. He won't talk to me about our future. He won't get his driver's license. Still wants sex though, even though it's painful to me and I need to see a gyno. Im happy he still wants me. Im afraid he will stop one day. Im still doing everything. Cooking, cleaning, planning meals, doing odd jobs for money. Ive lost everything it feels like but our room mate is covering us for now. I got us food stamps and medicaid and Im trying to get help, hence the diagnosis. Please don't harass me about being on snap, I don't want to be on it and they only give me 25$ a week. Have you ever tried to feed 2 adults on that amount?"
"summer classes are harder just because they're condensed. You're brain doesn't have time to process all of the information before more information is pounded upon you. If it feels hopeless, it's not! You can do it!","So I've had a less than perfect life. I joined the army. I graduated from a community college. I had major problems with my parents. (I've been living on my own struggling to survive for like a decade.)I went as a religious person living in a European country to ""preach the word"" for two years. I learned another language.Anyway I'm 30 years old trying to get a computer science degree. I thought all the math I needed was calculus 2. I made it through, and decided to take linear algebra over the summer. It's killing me. I have a test tomorrow. I've been doing like 14 hour days studying. (I have another class.) I have no shame, may I have some encouragement? Thank you reddit"
Sometimes life doesn't work out the way we wanted it to and it's okay because everything works out the way its supposed to. Take care of yourself and work your hardest to only move up from here on. Maybe getting a GED or finishing your high school credits are the first step.,"I still haven't graduated high school, never been to a college or a university, I have no training in anything, and I have no work experience. When applying for jobs those that are hiring don't care at all about my history they just see it as some big sob story or that I'm just lazy and didn't try hard enough. I'm going to try to get on Ontario Works (which is government aid) when my health card comes in the mail (have to have that to apply for Ontario Works, I don't know why but that's one of their rules.) So, I'll do that and I'll see what I can do about applying for work. Like I said before I really honestly do wanna work, I want to have a career I really do."
"If you haven't really stopped much to let yourself reflect (or even just have a lot of realizations all at once), it can hit you like a car so please be careful.","So around November 14th, he tells me I need to ""pause"" work until December 5th due to some cash flow issues that he needs to straighten out. I'm not happy with this but I can't do anything about it because I work remotely from home as a contract employee. But today's email tells me that all of my accounts are being deactivated to ""save money"" and that he hopes the team can get up and functional again in January and he hopes I'll be part of the team then.So I'm essentially now unemployed for all of December which means Christmas is going to suck even more than usual, and I'm probably going to spend the next couple of weeks struggling with the heavier bouts of depression and anxiety again.I've been applying for jobs both remote and local for two months now and I haven't gotten anything, no bites at all."
"Hang in there, u/rockrchick21. You're in good company. I bet half of Reddit proper is in the same position.(I mean jeez, I'm over 30 myself and haven't a clue what I'm doing with my life!...",I haven't cleaned my apartment in weeks. My husband and I currently live in a low income apartment building which doesn't allow for full student households. He is in school and if I take classes we would have to find another place to live. All of this is stressing me out so much and my husband is stressed out and checked out. I need anyone to talk to but I'm afraid to talk to my friends about this. When I talk to my husband he doesn't say much. I just need even a shred of support from anyone because the person I need it from the most is not in an emotional or mental place to give that.
"I failed the driving license test 3 times too! And from the comments, it looks like you passed! Congrats!","Please, encourage.Edit: thanks for kind words, everyone! I passed! I cant describe how helpful your kind words were. Thanks a lot! I am grateful to have Reddit installed on my phone, Jesus Christ. I can rest now."
,I blabbed about it.......I know it's dumb for getting upset about something like this.....but I was just wanting to give myself a party and just not have other people worry about costs of food cause i want to prove for others and just have fun and relax.....but I got so upset at myself cause I wasn't able to get the stuff I just cancelled everything.....And now I'm just getting drunk on my own to just forget how fucking stupid I can be at times.....I'm...... I'm sorry I couldn't get what I planned to have.
The biggest opportunity to find yourself and know who you are in this bleak time,I just fucking hate everything; I dont know what to do and I dont know how long Ill be like this. Nothing ever gets better and Im so sick of life
I understand how you feel. As Im actually about to leave for an event to try to do that same thing. Connect on some level with people. Mostly because my therapist told me thats what i needed to do. But every fiber of my being screams make up a reason not to go! But Ill go and Maybe enjoy it. Knowing that someone else has the same struggles helps. Take care of yourself!,"I have a tough time connecting with my dad (mom died 18 months ago). I am on the fence about whether my husband and I should really be together. Sometimes I would rather be by myself and my thoughts than other people. Sometimes my internal monologue is just really negative. Sometimes it just seems like too much to call a friend. Problem is, I have a son and I know I need to open up and show him how a person can connect. I don't really know where I need to go but I wish the guys from Queer eye could come and just fix my life in a week."
I understand!!! My college Caf is buffet style which is a no go. Trying to get off of it is a pain. But I too need encouragement for this! We can do it!I suggest having a final bad day. Start fresh tomorrow. ,"So Im not that chubby, I just have a little flab on my stomach that I want to get rid of. The way Im trying to lose it is by counting the calories of what I eat, and trying to eat a minimum of 1,200 calories per day. And thats all fine and dandy, but when I try to talk to my parents about what Im trying to do, they just keep on saying that Im trying to hard, and that I need to just eat when Im hungry.I really want to lose that flab, and having my parents not support me that much is a bit discouraging. Can anyone bring my motivation back a little bit? "
Get up and study! Think of the good grade you will get! Don't be overwhelmed though and just relax. You can do this!,Can I get some words of encouragement please? I have an exam on Tuesday that I barely studied for maybe a maximum of 1 hour I've studied for it and I just need some encouragement some words that will get my ass up to my computer and to my books so I can go study

The only thing that excites me is ending the suffering once and for all I have an entire plan! I just need some encouragement please I love you all so much,Hi! Every time I post for encouragement to end it all people keep telling me to get help and try supporting me by saying Ill get through it but really Ive been fighting for too long. I was born to kill myself i just know it. So can you guys help me by telling me its the right thing to do it would help a lot
"Not to put false hope there if you decide you're over the girl, but things can change.","I'm a 20 year old guy who struggles with bipolar depression. I attend college but honestly have no real clue what I wanna do with my life, I have a very strong interest in mathematics though and would love to help advance technology. Last semester I got straight As but sacrificed my social life for it, and now even when I try to make friends at school, nobody shares similar interests to myself or cares to pay any attention to me. Everyone else just cares about stuff I don't care about like drugs or video games, I want to get out and explore new things. I love action sports but I have lost interest recently due to both my depression and lack of friends to bike and skate with."
"There are also a lot of mindfulness exercises for anxiety online, which might help you.As for your routines.","I'm in a very strange period right now and I'm still trying to figure it out, but I'll try to describe it the best I can. Events in chronological order:During the quarantine, I took the time to workout and eat better. I had the discipline and the determination to lose weight and get fitter.Since June, work has been stressful, because of upcoming deadlines. I got me in a procrastination-due-to-anxiety state. My work isn't great, but it's not terrible either. I'm planning on getting at least decent results before July.This weekend, we got very bad news in the family.Since then, I feel like I want to lose control of my life."
I wouldnt worry about your writing skills too much. The point of an MA is to teach you how to write well last time I checked. I just wish you the best of luck in your studies and I hope it goes well. Congratulations on your bio degree,"And, although the encouragement made me feel good about myself, I couldn't help but start to feel trapped in my academic path: ""I'm the only one of the grandchildren who's academically inclined, the others have shown absolutely no interest in pursuing a university degree...Hell, they've nicknamed me 'the biologist', I can't stop now, I'll surely let everybody down"". So, I finished my biology degree (nothing fancy, no co-op, no job waiting for me when I graduated, nothing), but now I've been thinking about getting a Master's in literature, or fine arts, or English (in about 3 years). I'm still scared that I would be making a stupid mistake by choosing a MA instead of a MSc, and that I would regret it, especially since I don't even believe my writing is that good."
"I am at the one place that I felt loved in my entire life. A 3 year old showed me love and acceptance that day, it was also the day that her mother started distancing from me. I dont know why, never will. The most happy day in my life and it will never happen again. I won't have that life that I had for that day.","We talked about getting a house together and cooking dinner and watching movies and playing with her daughter, we created a life that we both wanted. I met her very young daughter and fell in love with them even more quickly. She told me she loved me and wanted a future with me. We promised that if it wasnt working out we would tell each other and not just ghost the other, we did a pinky swear that we would not breakup over text, that we would not ghost each other as it had happened to us both, we would show each other the love we feel in that moment as a promise.We did OK for the few weeks after she was laid off and we couldnt go out as much."
Just as your focus has shifted towards Christ so has my focus as well and it started somewhere in 2018 while I was attending medical school and had a part time job. Although in the midst of school I had asked him what about school?,"I believe once you get into aviation you have to make up your mindset about facing such unprecedented times, as aviation is a cyclic industry a lot of factors come into play and the whole sector depends on these factors to work effectively."
"Even though I did something not the way I should have (which is honestly not the issue with You, that was just bad luck, everyone deserves to be lazy sometimes) I always tell myself that I might have lost something, but I gained experience that will prevent it from happening in the future.","Looks like the depression and disappointment hit me post midnight, as Im currently up at 5 am typing this. You know when only *one* small thing goes wrong then suddenly youre all up in a rut about every life decision youve made? Well, Im feeling really shitty about the fact that technically I allowed two things of my own possession to get slightly damaged, all in one night. Due to being lazy in bed, I asked my dad to shake my lava lamp to let the floating hardened liquid to sink towards the bottom. He shook it too hard, causing the whole thing to fall apart and for the lightbulb to lose one of its connector pieces. He said hed go to the hardware store soon to replace the lightbulb, but Im in slight doubt if the lamp will work after that, feeling that its my fault, in technical aspects. If I had simply gotten up to do it myself, then my lamp would have been fine."
"If you really trust your manager, then let them know what a burden this is putting on you.In time, as you continue in management roles, you'll get to hire your own teams instead of inheriting problems. Identify what traits your team has that you like and which ones you don't and use this as a learning opportunity so you can be more careful when you hire more people.Management and leadership can be stressful and lonely.","I work in a corporate environment so it's very tricky to fire someone. This can be hard bc I'm in need to make an example of so.eone but instead people have figured out how to work the system. I go home and I feel so low. I guess its bc I really wanted to be great to my team but I feel like the group I have is horrible. They always have an issue, whether personal, or just unhappy with the job. They come in with a negative attitude and it sucks the life out of me to be positive for them and the rest of my team. The hard part is the need to treat them as though I dont hate them and still provide great management and fairness. I'm just kind of complaining but I'm in some real need of any encouragement right now. This job is not what I wanted it to be and I'm becoming really unhappy due to it."

"Hey Carbon, you sound really intelligent from how you write! You've got a plan towards your dreams, it just wasn't what you originally thought it was going to be. Life is like that sometimes. It takes a really strong person to stand up from failure and continue to persevere to their dreams.",I had taken multiple AP and honors classes and so our GPA had the possibility of jumping past a 4.0.
Im sure theyll understand why you want to take a part time job. They may very well value education for their workers. Just let them know as soon as possible so they can accommodate your situation better.,"Hi all! I think this is a really neat subreddit, just found y'all.I'm talking to a friend and her father tomorrow about a job at their (essentially family) company. I plan to tell them that I'll only work part-time because I want to pursue a Master's degree with reduced tuition, which requires being an employee of the University I attended. I think they'll be disappointed I only plan to go on part-time, but my passion isn't in that work, and I'm not pressed for cash right now. Ideally, a job will open at the University in student services (my desired career field) soon! They're on a hiring freeze due to COVID-19.I could just use some encouragement that the conversation with them will be fine, and that I'll end up enjoying my time there. I'm nervous about letting them down."

Self-worship is a lonely religion. Children and society at large suffer because of it. You're doing the right thing to focus on being a good mother to your son.,"He goes into a rage and starts calling me out of my name and berating me once again. He's telling me I'm trash, that's why I don't have a ring on my finger, all of my relationships in the future will result in men passing me around because I'm a grimy person. I fall for this trap and lose my shit and get into a verbal altercation with him. What made me really blow a gasket is when he tells me that he gave me another chance and I haven't changed my behavior. I hang up on him. I decided to call him later in the day and noticed my number was blocked. This isn't the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth time he's done this either."
But my point is there is no question that you can absolutely crush this class.2. It just takes time to get back into the rhythm of classes/homework/test prep. You need to corner your teacher after class and get clear expectations for what problems you should be drilling and what will be on upcoming tests.,Hi. I finished my original degree 17 years ago and have worked in IT since then but the past year had really made me fall out of \~\~love\~\~ like with that. I've wanted a masters for a long time with the idea that eventually I'd pursue a new career as a public policy analyst so I've gone back to undergraduate courses in economics and math with the idea if I do well I'll pursue a masters in economics but if not maybe public policy or political science or just go back to work. Of note I'm married with a 6 moth old daughter.Well...I showed up to my first calculus test (I originally passed it with an 89.6 in 2002 but am retaking it to prepare for calculus II) and the teacher told us we couldn't use our calculators and to put them away. We all panic. I didn't even finish the test.
Maybe make a batch of hard boiled eggs and now you have egg salad sammies for dinner all week and you dont have to stop at McDonalds or try to make a meal.

Im pretty broke, I cant visit my husband because the drive is so far and challenging and I only have less than 48 hours to make the trip. Im dealing with the loss of my mom, and how Im so unavailable because of my job, but I cant take a break from it because I wont get paid for it. Plus Im just feeling so shitty and unhappy with my body and Im just struggling so much. I know Ill be ok, but like...its just been bad day after bad day. Im a very positive person and have been handling this well, but Im having a spiral moment. Advice, encouragement and positivity are welcome. Thanks Reddit."
"Just dedicate some time to yourself once in a while, you can only work so much.","I'm an artist with original story ideas, many of them over 10 years old, but I've never been able to sit down and finish them. And that fact tends to extend to so many projects. I'm capable of doing so much art for others at huge speeds (commissions) and in that sense I'm super productive (multiple illustrations a day, even if rhey are small). I can easily sit down in the morning and producing art until before bed, but when it comes to my own stuff, it's almost impossible to just sit down and finish projects, be it an artbook, a plot, a comic, a game... I always end falling back into drawing commissions or illustrations, which I can finish with ease.It seems so many gamedevs or comic artists finished projects by the time they were my age or just a bit younger."
"And when you accept that fact, it changes your life.If you're worried that you're not the same person you were before the break ... everyone wakes up different than they were yesterday. Is that a bad analogy?","I tend to have a very small circle of friends these two in particular are a couple that I had spent nearly half my days with for the past couple years. I felt a deep bond between us.They read my proposal, and their reaction was basically holy shit. We sat there talking about the possibilities for an hour straight.I got overwhelmed and needed to cool off in their bathroom. I was looking at myself in the mirror, and I could feel my brain pulsating and *moving*, like it was rewiring so rapidly that it was causing a physical sensation. Ive never felt anything like it.I suddenly felt enormous guilt. It was as if the universe was angry with me. I had opened Pandoras Box. I was this underaccomplished loser that barely achieved anything noteworthy in my life, always felt like a disappointment to my family, and here I had just stumbled across something that could change the world."
"I believe in you. I'm sure that the only reason people seem to squash your other ideas is because of their own expectations for you. They probably think there is ""one right path"" for you but honestly, that is simply not true.","I only need to hear that things will be fine. Ive been trying to find a job for a year and corona destroyed even the fragile chances I had before. I keep applying but I just dont see it working, and every time that I come up with an alternative plan or idea, *all* I hear from my surroundings is yes, but.... Or people give me a pitiful look that makes me wish I hadnt said anything. I used to think I was brilliant and could do a lot of things. Now I just feel useless."
"If you are someone who's been pretty routine based that hasn't noticed how you're feeling much up until all of this has taken place, then this can be a massively good thing, if you take it forward with you and are always more aware of how you're feeling when things do get back to ""normal"". You've got an opportunity here to grow new insights.","I know a lot of people are in the same place and some even worse. Right now, Im finding it extremely difficult to get used to this new way of life, and I could use some encouraging words to push forward through this."
"Hey, if you go a bit early see if you can find a court support worker to sit with you.","Just need a little encouragement. A man threatened suicide when I told him I no longer wanted to date. I helped him get help and when I thought the situation deescalated, I left. He since has sent numerous texts and emails. Finally (much, much later when I thought this was over) he sent a 4-page letter to my house claiming that I caused all of the anxiety, depression, and desire to end it all."
People deserve to know you and to be in connection with you. I like to remind people that they're unique. That means that your life is *unrepeatable*.,I guess I just have to do that for myself. I think I need to force myself to go out and talk to other people and do things to bring me in to connection with the world. I just feel like hiding under a blanket for the rest of my life. I of course can't do that. Wish I could be different as I constantly don't like myself. Not really sure what I'm asking.
Sorry I havent been here in a few days. But thanks so much for the positive words. Sometimes we just need to hear the words from someone else. Thanks and I hope you all have a great weekend. Ill try to remember to come back here and update! ,"Hi all!Im (40F) just looking for people to tell me its going to be ok. I suffer from anxiety disorder which means I overthink trying to figure out or solve my problems. I get a physical reaction in my body when my anxiety rises up. My heart races but also feels like it drops into my stomach. My stomach starts twisting and flipping and getting jittery. My face becomes flushed and I also feel light headed.Internally Im freaking out but tend to express it through irritation and anger.

We are more anxious and depressed these days because of our culture. With the internet and media we are under a microscope and we are constantly being pressured to be perfect. Perfect body, perfect skin, perfect routine, perfect eating habits, the way you sleep, the way the way you stand, the way you parent, perfect fulfilled fun lives. Every single thing we do we are pressured with the fact that we arent good enough. We arent doing it right. We arent doing it perfectly. We live in an illusion that some people are but its all just a magic trick. People put on a fake face. No one truly knows whats real anymore, so we sit there thinking we arent good enough, we arent as good as everyone else. We have access to all the bad news around the world like never  before."

"I hear parenthood refocuses a person's priorities and perspective on life.

I applied to a pet store a couple of months ago and never got a call. I figured, if they won't hire me, who will? I think I'm ready to try again. There's a little Japanese restaurant down the street that's not too busy, maybe I could handle it? I think I will go there today and ask about a job."
"Hey, if you go a bit early see if you can find a court support worker to sit with you.","Just need a little encouragement. A man threatened suicide when I told him I no longer wanted to date. I helped him get help and when I thought the situation deescalated, I left. He since has sent numerous texts and emails. Finally, he sent a 4-page letter to my house claiming that I caused all of the anxiety, depression, and desire to end it all. I filed a PFA (protection from abuse) against him. He is an abuser and its going to take a lot to be in the same room as him tomorrow - and to listen to him make up his version of reality, and to fight the protection I am seeking.I am hoping against hope that the judge believes me and is willing to grant this order to give me some peace of mind."

A few months ago on I was promoted to my first management position. I was so excited to be In leadership and I really thought I could make a difference in someone's career. About 2 months ago I got my team, all new hires, and almost all straight out of  college with little or no job experience. They are so rough. After rigorous training almost all of them are rough, to be expected of course.What I wasnt expecting is to have 4 HR issues right of the bat and them escalating me to leadership above me. I have 3 that are are written warnings for attendance, 1 more and will be termed. 1 went to my leadership and asked if I was right. Unfortently I so know this may happen as people might be unhappy, especially if they are having performance issues. All day my leaders tell me that i have such a bad team and they feel so bad for me, that I'm doing great handling it and it's really breaking me in."

As a kid and teenager since I'm female I was taught by my parents that all I'll be good for is cooking, cleaning, and making babies and that's it. I just don't want that to be true.

Its not how you failed its about how you get up and try again.,"Im 16 and from the UK left school 5 months ago, I had no idea of what I wanted to do, what courses I wanted to take at collage, in my 15/16 year old mind I was done with education and wanted something right then and there people would be proud of me for, something that was different and went against my depiction from friends and family as a smart retard with sense of humour that doesnt shut up, so I joined the armed forces, at 16 thats a big thing."

Something about her told you that she wasn't the one right now... so remember that. It doesn't mean that she isn't the one for you- just right now it doesn't seem to work.,"Lately I've been feeling really shitty. I'm a senior in high school, and I'm on my way to being valedictorian, which is great, but I feel under a lot of pressure to win a ton of scholarships and get into some fantastic school. I have practically no support, as my friends just assume that I'm some genius, rather than a hard worker, and I would feel strange complaining about good grades. I recently broke up with my girlfriend of a year and a half, and I've been so active that I feel like I haven't had any time to get my mind straight. She was one of the few people I really connected with, and I had been planning my whole future around the idea of us being together, so now I'm chugging along with no clear destination.

You got this. I have a mother who is the same way. She has no boundaries and feels the need to take care of me. I am the only one of the siblings that isnt married so she is constantly doing everything for me. I had to tell her i was leaving the country to live with my bf for three months.

Many of us appreciate you. High five!,"Hi all, I'm a nurse, working in the time of Covid. All politics aside, its just a really hard time to be a nurse. Long hours, frayed tempers, everyone is on edge. I'm just fried, and I miss my coping mechanisms of pedicures, massages, and spa days.

I am just a weak man who has to much emotion in his soul and his heart has died again.Look in my history, I wrote something last night, but I did not do it, though I could see myself doing it and even I would admit that I wanted to.

Why nursing?:As I mentioned before my passion and my driven mood is in the medical field.

While we frequently meet under exceptionally troublesome conditionsbeing available as individuals face genuine wellbeing difficulties or wounds, seeing the snapshot of birth or the finish of lifewe become more acquainted with our patients rapidly and have the chance to assume a significant function in their lives. I turned into an attendant so I could affect the lives of others and have a role that felt important.Why not dental, pharmacy, or any other career?I have looked into each of these careers and more but my whole academic career was based around being a medical school student. Ranging from classes to volunteer hours."

Keep ur chin up youre doing fine. You cant choose your circumstances in life but u can choose how u live ur life. I'll be pulling for ya,"I've lived my entire life with shit being thrown at me. My parents/family and almost my culture are somehow very confused about encouragement and are often very absolved by cynicism and bullshit in the way they interact with people.(Example: While being in a soccer game at the age of 11, my team was losing very badly and as I looked out to the bleachers for some encouragement I heard my family laughing at me and shaking their heads saying how useless I was. The rest of the parents would yell things like ""Good try!""""You can do it!"" and ""It's all about having fun."")

I've lost jobs, friends, relationships etc. It seems the only way to keep the demons away is to just cease to be here. I've had another fairly bad episode this past week and I'm worried about my job.

I recently broke up with my girlfriend of a year and a half, and I've been so active that I feel like I haven't had any time to get my mind straight.

"There are new positives, new negatives, new stresses, and new strengths to discover.","I know a lot of people are in the same place and some even worse. Right now, Im finding it extremely difficult to get used to this new way of life, and I could use some encouraging words to push forward through this."
"Well friend, I am relieved to hear that you are planning to see a therapist. I understand it may be scary for you, but I can assure you that the therapist will pass no judgement to you and will not yell at you.",It's ramen and bread and my weight just stays the same.
Just as your focus has shifted towards Christ so has my focus as well and it started somewhere in 2018 while I was attending medical school and had a part time job. Although in the midst of school I had asked him what about school?,"And Covid has uprooted these factors and brought it to a pause.During such times, one can lose their peace and its ripple effect can be seen in different ways. When we get comfortable at something we avoid going through the process of re-aligning to anything else. Because it takes away our peace and identity. We lose out on something which was very dear to us, when our identity is lost, hope also takes a backseat and we are left hanging just to be tossed around by the unprecedented consequences, like in this Covid. This begs some fundamental questions, where does your identity lie? What things are you putting your hope on? Weve seen and understood clearly nothing is permanent. This diminishing hope is very insecure and can cover our mind with anxiousness and fear."
"I'm not sure I could help *lots* but here's a good place to start. First, don't criticise yourself for feeling bad about this.",A boy I was talking to just starting hanging out with his ex again and I found out. Hes a liar but I was really into him and my feelings are really hurt. Im starting to think Ill never be good enough for anybody. Im aware that I shouldnt worry about dumb boys but I cant help but to feel shitty. I should love myself to let him go but I still miss him and wish hed just come back and say the right things. Any advice on how to get over a mini relationship? I feel like I did all the right things and still failed. :/
"I know that money might be an issue for you now though, but if there's any way you would be able to pull it off then I would absolutely suggest doing so. I would very much recommend trying to have your Fianc do the same if she's not already.","Ive been on a downward spiralMy fianc and I have moved in together at the start of 2020, which either highlighted or exposed some major dependency issues that she has. On top of that, her mental health has been beyond terrible for herwhich is likely a huge driving force for the dependencyand Ive gotten Caregivers Fatigue 3 or 4 times already. I desperately want to communicate this issue but she can already read it off of me (been together for a long time) which is making her mental health worse at times, and I think if we were to outright have that conversation it would cause her mental health to be even worse. She also gets upset that it seems like I view her as helpless and unable to function without me, and admittedly I do because shes so extremely needyI hate myself physically. Literally from my head to my toes: I cant find a good haircut and the barber that I helped out with that couldnt be consistent, then COVID hit and Im out a barber &amp; reference point for my hair."

I am confident that the doctors will find at least one way to help you. So dont give up. Youll feel better, even if it only means feeling emotionally better. May you feel better soon",I have had a rough year and part of the problem is my undiagnosed anxiety.I had a stressful job in January that was pretty much the wild west. But I needed the job because drama at work is sleds stressful than being homeless. In Feb I got super sick and got the flu that turned into a respiratory infection for 3 and half weeks but I got through it. Then I decided to volunteer in some religious work for a few months which ironically stressed me out. Then my job got even worse because we had a ton of layoffs. I was able to find a really good government job but I stressed myself out during the month long process. Then my grandad died and that is a whole can of worms with my crazy family. Stressed me to no end. I ended up not feeling half my body the day after my grandad died. My right side became more and more numb.

I haven't even been there 6 months. My sister in law expressed that she wanted me out last night. After they encourage me to go to my best friend's wedding in another state and get involved in a local sport (which cost money), I was informed that she was pissed that I had bought sports equipment the other night and that it was becoming time for me to leave. She wasn't mean about it. She just stated that it was time for her to have her space back. I'm worried that after all the changes I have been making, I'm back where I started.

"Hey, you can absolutely do this! I actually moved to NYC at 24 and it was definitely scary. But if youre starting a degree you will have no problem making friends. And the city is full of people like you with big dreams. Youll fit right in! Plus its less scary once you get there.","I want to move to NYC next year and start my degree as an FNP, but Im scared. What if I dont make friends? Those first few months might be really lonely especially in the fall. At the same time Im 26 years old and have dreamed of living in NYC since I was 13.

Scored 95% and 92% on the first two exams of my most challenging class, but basically flunked everything else in my other classes.Part of me just... died. I feel like I peeked behind the curtain and cant return to reality in the same way. I can barely take care of myself. I dont *want* to take care of myself.

Meanwhile everyone in the Xbox party is being told why their bad or why he's not playing now and it's your fault.

She said she also had feelings for me and we were proud of each other for finally letting it out. However, ever since then it feels like there is a rift in the friendship that I had zero intention of creating, you see, I never fully wanted to get into a relationship as she had just started her freshman year of college and I am in my Junior year of highschool(we're only a year apart in age) so we were both stressed with school."

"Dont sweat it man, its a nice gesture and she will love it. I think now is a good time to look back on our 2012 friends and remember the YOLO saying... You only get one chance in life so take every shot you can no matter how many you miss the ones that you make will make it all worth it. Good luck man.","Putting aside the anxiety I'm feeling about just giving them to her, I'm utterly *terrified* she's going to think this is some kind of assholish passive-aggressive one-upmanship because I'm making the cannoli rather than buying it like she did with the cheesecake."
"hello, fellow Canadian here. Close to Toronto. I can understand how frustrating this is for you and I am sorry you are going through this alone. I am not in a similar position but I am sure there are lots of people in the same position as you.","I'm just alone in this big city, no license, no job, and the Covid19 situation makes it hard for me to connect to communities, to feel like I have a future. There are only a few places left that are affordable for low income people in Canada, and those places have high unemployment and are car dependent. I guess I wish I knew someone who was struggling financially and mentally ill, I'm so alone and scared in my own country."
"I music direct musical theatre (well, I used to pre-COVID) and would love to hear your work! One of my favourite things was when I could invite an artist to work on a show who had a YouTube or SoundCloud channel.","Hello, it's been a long-time secret hobby of mine to record stuff for fun, but i never had the guts to share my small projects with anyone. Not a single soul. Early this year, I created a YT channel where I can start first by making covers before posting my own-----except that I am still too nervous to share it with others. The thought itself is nerve-wracking for me. Just now, I did try with a friend but it is still making me anxious.I know I need to let others hear my outputs because I need feedback to improve. How do you think I should go about this? I hope it's okay to ask on here. :(Thank you in advance!"
Trust in it. If you think he will be fine better to believe and find out! Way to be brave!,"Im about to tell my partner Im bisexual. I was super pumped to tell him earlier but now that Im here with him Im really nervous and feel like I cant do it.

Check plus.=)3) You have friends.,I haven't cleaned my apartment in weeks. My husband and I currently live in a low income apartment building which doesn't allow for full student households. He is in school and if I take classes we would have to find another place to live. All of this is stressing me out so much and my husband is stressed out and checked out. I need anyone to talk to but I'm afraid to talk to my friends about this. When I talk to my husband he doesn't say much. I just need even a shred of support from anyone because the person I need it from the most is not in an emotional or mental place to give that.
"Hey Carbon, you sound really intelligent from how you write! You've got a plan towards your dreams, it just wasn't what you originally thought it was going to be. Life is like that sometimes.

We all do,"Now, when my parents homeschooled me there wasn't much information about it and not a whole lot of people did it, it just wasn't as common as it is now. There wasn't as many curriculum's then as there is now and the curriculum's weren't as advanced as the one's now. So, anyways when my parents pulled me out of school I was in the 5th grade but after testing me on a few things to see where I was, most of what I knew was a kindergarten level maybe grade one. So, it was very hard work but I did catch up, although unfortunately because my Autism (it's not my parents fault, they honestly tried and so did I) I wasn't able to do the work required of me to graduate. There were subjects I just couldn't grasp and understand at the time. So, I wasn't able to graduate high school."
But the few lucky amount of us born get to experience that. If there werent nightmares then good dreams would be lost.,"I have for quite a while now. Thats not really the truth though. I do feel something. Fear. Im afraid of losing those I care about. Im afraid that Im not good enough. Even now, Im afraid that youre thinking Im being melodramatic when all Im really doing is trying to describe whats going on in my head. I know Im self destructive and I dont care. That makes me afraid of the person behind the mask I put on every day to face the world.I want someone to care. Anyone."
"A good partner would have been extra affectionate throughout your recovery, made sure you took enough time to get better, celebrated your successes and asked you about your follow up appointments.She parroted some hyper traditionalist nonsense that made you anxious at a time you most needed her support.You can do so much better.",Thank you all for your kind words.
The caveat is that youre feeling great to be free of the tyranny. My point here is that part of a job is going out of your way to preempt the kinds of problems that end up becoming intolerable. Get back on the horse and find something else.,"I called my manager explained to him how I have been giving it my all, and it doesn't seem to be enough for these two and despite my coming to you about this on multiple occasions it's not improved, so I'm leaving. I gathered my things told my coworkers I was clocking out and left.I'm at a point now, where I've never done this before. I've always had something else lined up. It's a bit scary, but I do have some money saved and support from my bf, friends, and family if needed. Still it feels crazy to bet on myself for once and not settle for a job just because it's a job. I want to pursue my passion, which is ultimately to help people live better lives."
"It hangs over you like a dark cloud when you leave something unfinished. What you're doing takes a lot of courage, hard work, a financial burden, dedication, and above all it demands that you have faith in yourself. You've got this.","They love me and are trying to support me, but I think they miss the point... and I've only felt worse since I began making these fears known. To clarify I'm going back for a science BA in geology, a passion of mine. Any sort of words of positivity or encouragement would go a long way for me. I try my best to be an optimist, but lately I feel very pessimistic about this very big deal in my life that I was originally looking so forward to."
A true friend will not leave you during the messed up times. For example my best friend made a dumb mistake and got 30 days in jail. Most of her family and friends who knew about it made her feel like a loser and not a good person.,"I guess Ill explain my situation. For about 3 months now Ive been talking to this girl. After our first date she said she didnt feel anything for me and so I tried to move on. After about a week of not talking to her she texted me asking how my day was. Since that day she started talking to me non stop every day. She then started to get kind of flirty and lead me on. When I talked to her about it, she said she was confused because she didnt feel anything originally and now she thinks things are changing. I was excited and so I just kept doing what I was doing and things were going great. Things went bad on Friday the 27th."
"Whether big, small, or anything in between. We all struggle with self doubt, I believe we all do, but you will be amazed with the strength inside you to conquer.",It took me awhile to figure this out but i have a fear of things working out too well for me due to superstitions (like it falling apart ) or just doing so well that i have responsibilities that i cant handle. And it holds me back SO much that i dont wanna leave my comfort zone of doing the same boring things every day even though i hate it so much..Some encouragement or advice would be wonderful:) thanks in advance
"I certainly dont say this to provide the impression that you should feel better than them because they are actually worse off, but know that they are no better than you because they are skinny, pretty, etc.. They, too, struggle.","There's a reason I work the evening shift. I know this is a petty thing to get hung up on in the face of such an otherwise-perfect opportunity, but it's been a VERY long time since I've been required to get up early on a regular basis. And now I'm on medication with a side effect of insomnia. My current situation is unsustainable, and these early classes will allow me to stick with my usual evening shift; but I have a long history of being easily discouraged and can already feel myself backpedaling. I need someone to talk me out of talking myself out of this."
Hopefully youre seeing a therapist or getting some help for your depression and anxiety. I like to describe depression as your brain is lying to you.,So my friend and I have known each for a long time and my friend lives across the country hes the same age as me and overreacts at everything when we talk and play with each other I say something offensive that was meant to be a joke he takes it seriously and now because I was being insecure about who I really am he cant trust me I share almost everything with him but...now Im not sure if he wants to stay friends..I care deeply about my friend and would never want to hurt him but i dont know what to do anymore and thats not even Half the shit I feel Im 14 years old and I have had anxiety attacks on and off day in and day out my family isnt that great and I keep everything from them even tho I shouldnt but when I do try to open up they try to help but instead make it worse I dont shit.i know people think that Im just a little girl and know nothing about life or love or pain but Im hurt and I have no one else to talk to...I came here because I needed to rant but looking back on these things that I say I feel worthless and Pitiful and ashamed...I used to cut my thighs thinking it was going to make me feel better and it did for a while but then it didnt and I started cutting harder and deeper making myself bleed and my thighs werent enough so I cut my wrists and told myself to hide them one day I was so depressed and felt almost nothing emotionally that I tried planning my death and when I was going to do it.

Im praying for you!!","Im in desperate need of encouragement and advice or just anything positive. Im going through a very tough time in my life. My husbands cancer has spread and hell be having surgery this month. Hes staying with his Mom house in my hometown, so were living apart. We probably need to move back to my hometown after a year living hours away since our support system is there and since thats where my husbands team of doctors is based. My mom just died in March and because Im a contractor for my current job, they didnt pay me for the whole week and a half of work that I was out. So moneys been tight. I had to replace my tires recently. Work hasnt paid me back for my travel expenses."
Oh wow! That's amazing! You are so brave!,"Just need a little encouragement. A man threatened suicide when I told him I no longer wanted to date. I helped him get help and when I thought the situation deescalated, I left. He since has sent numerous texts and emails. Finally (much, much later when I thought this was over) he sent a 4-page letter to my house claiming that I caused all of the anxiety, depression, and desire to end it all."
Not to say that it doesn't happen; it's just unlikely.,"My friends say Im pretty but I think theyre lying.

I try to stay fit too so its not like, health wise, were super different. I dont think it could ever work out anyways and I dont think his friends would approve of him dating me and I also think that  he would probably go chase the pretty girls that are also in the AP classes and equally as smart as him.

"Physical and mental self-care is something I still struggle with, but when I muster up the patience to commit to it in ""manageable chunks"", it's left me feeling much, much better about myself. I consider a hobby or project a form of mental self-care.","Im in too low of a funk to consistently care about maintaining my beard which is as frustrating as daily care would be. Ive been gaining fat all of 2020 which not only do I want to lose weight but Im also a nutrition major so thats not a good look. Ive been having toenail issues for about a year now, which tops it off for the head to toe partIm unemployed right now and couldnt get unemployment, so thats really rough. Im really thankful that money isnt as big of an issue as it would be for most people, but I find myself sitting in my car in a random parking lot just to get out of the house. I legit lost all of my friends in 2019 with not even the slightest explanation."
"Hi there! Believe it or not, youve actually set yourself in the right direction, even if theyre small baby steps. What youve done is simply acknowledge that youre unwell and that you need help from a professional, which is completely fine and okay.","Shortest version I can share, it seems these days without oversharing (especially with strangers). Is that I need professional help. Everyone has stuff, thats my usual line anyway. We all have our own baggage. Our own issues, our own brand of fucked up history to lug around like a genetic trait as unavoidable as a recessive gene, as glaring as a pink elephant in the middle of the Sahara, still I digress... I lack the necessary motivation to move in a positive direction."

Especially if her mental health issues are impacting you in a negative way. And dude...be kind to yourself. I know that may seem so hard right now but make sure you're not being too hard on yourself.,"Ive been on a downward spiralMy fianc and I have moved in together at the start of 2020, which either highlighted or exposed some major dependency issues that she has. On top of that, her mental health has been beyond terrible for herwhich is likely a huge driving force for the dependencyand Ive gotten Caregivers Fatigue 3 or 4 times already. I desperately want to communicate this issue but she can already read it off of me (been together for a long time) which is making her mental health worse at times, and I think if we were to outright have that conversation it would cause her mental health to be even worse. She also gets upset that it seems like I view her as helpless and unable to function without me, and admittedly I do because shes so extremely needyI hate myself physically.

I do not understand why I suddenly care so much about what people are gonna think to see a 26 year old doing beginner tricks. Especially since my friends are such good supporters, they wouldn't make fun of me even if I super flubbed a trick.I understand confidence is a big factor in magic, in any performance art so I'd love to hear some inspiring words to help me shake off this apprehension.Thank you all ahead of time!"

Im actually in my Tanjiro cosplay right now, and I want to post it to /r/cosplay, but Im really scared someone will diss me because its not good or I dont have contacts or something. This is kind of a stupid problem and pretty light compared to some of the other, heavier stuff on this subreddit."
"The best advice I can give, is to be patient with her. Ive been in similar situations, and pushing to open up has never been fruitful. You both are growing, and experiencing new things.

She said she also had feelings for me and we were proud of each other for finally letting it out.

I'm capable of doing so much art for others at huge speeds (commissions) and in that sense I'm super productive (multiple illustrations a day, even if rhey are small). I can easily sit down in the morning and producing art until before bed, but when it comes to my own stuff, it's almost impossible to just sit down and finish projects, be it an artbook, a plot, a comic, a game...

I have no more savings, we have his income and health benefits now, but we are still struggling on one income.I have had a few interviews and I never get a call back. I have applied at some clothing stores, too, but they don't even call me for an interview. I am looking for a career, though, not a part-time job. I have also applied for key holders, reception, teaching (I have a TEFL certificate) , in theatre (I have a degree), but there are no call backs for me. I have 7 years landscaping with 2 of those as supervisor, and 1 being on my own. I don't have a degree in landscape design (just experience) nor do I have a florist certificate (which I am getting but it does cost almost 3300 CAD)."

I failed because I couldn't parallel park. I tried to practice beforehand but I didn't have a whole lot of time, it was all so rushed. I feel awful.

I'm really disheartened by my love life right now- every time I start to wind up pushing the boundaries of ""just friends"", when it's usually not even initiated by me at all, it falls apart when the guy ""isnt ready"" or (usually this is the case) afraid or something. It makes me feel like shit, that they dont especially care and that they are just too chickenshit to tell me they arent into me like that Idk it's happening yet again where he initiated everything at first and then it flipped, where i feel like I'm the one that cares more and it's annoying.

I'm not happy with this but I can't do anything about it because I work remotely from home as a contract employee. But today's email tells me that all of my accounts are being deactivated to ""save money"" and that he hopes the team can get up and functional again in January and he hopes I'll be part of the team then.So I'm essentially now unemployed for all of December which means Christmas is going to suck even more than usual, and I'm probably going to spend the next couple of weeks struggling with the heavier bouts of depression and anxiety again.I've been applying for jobs both remote and local for two months now and I haven't gotten anything, no bites at all."
"Let this be a lesson to not allow someone to flirt without being honest about their feelings. You can always set a boundary of what you will and wont accept. Like if you want to be together cool, if not stop flirting, we are just friends.",The subject of our relationship status got brought up again and she said she was conflicted and part of her wants to just remain friends and part of her wants something more. I asked her if we could talk about it in person but we had to end up FaceTiming. It turns out all that flirting and leading on was her intentionally doing that to see if she was interested. What I took as affection turned out to be experimentation and at this point she was trying to avoid telling me the truth. Ive been rejected before but this one was different. She was leading me on for a month and a half and I thought I was really getting somewhere. The fact that she tried to feel that way for me and couldnt made everything worse. I know this may sound irrational but I cant help feel that there is something wrong with me and that Im screwed up and thats why this happened to me. Every time I put myself out there I get hurt and this one was a huge blow to the gut.

I'm looking for some pick me up so when I get down I have something to reference to keep me moving. The list is: * Cancel all my monthly subscriptions (google music, audible, 8fit and so on) Except netflix and hulu, so I at lease have some happy things to watch*Downgrade cable/tv/internet to internet only - It's cheaper to hold on to my netflix hulu combo with internet service than it is to have the whole package*Sell unnecessary things like the Harley I own that I got so he and I could ride together, past that I have no interest."

"Each day has enough trouble of its own""AndMatthew 5:25""Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes?","My wife and I recently moved to be closer to her family to help with childcare. I was making $40,000+/yr at a restaurant. I've worked in restaurants most of my life and have truly come to hate it. So with the move, I decided to try to do something different. So I got a job in a completely different industry and now only make $15.50/ hr, about $30,000/yr. My wife just got a job making $13/hr. I'm struggling seeing us making enough money to obtain our goals. We are currently living with her parents."
"If you can organize wtf needs to be done, and make the time and space for it to get done, you can master college. Make a routine of studying. After class ends, don't go home, go to the library and make yourself put in another hour or two of studying.","In the past week alone, Ive gotten two 45s on quizzes and i feel like everything is crashing around me. Im not even doing poorly really (all As and a B) but my peers are doing better than I am and dont hesitate to tell me that. I dont want to do worse than I am, and honestly I cant afford it. I dont even know what im doing, and everything is just too much."
"My parents used to take my brother and I on family walks to try and get extra movement in, sometimes with the whole family, other times just one of them with one of us and so on depending on what was going on.I dont have kids, but my mum was a single parent for ages and part of how she managed to make sure we stayed eating healthy was to take time to plan the weekly grocery shop based on what she planned to cook for dinner during the week.(She was also a ""surgical strike"" shopper so would zip through the grocery store only buying what was on her list to save time/money.)","I recently got married, then my wife and I decided to foster, then we moved. All within a year and a half. We both use to be so active almost every day. I understand parenting is a priority but with this current child we literally cannot get out of the house. It's just too hard. I use to ride/run up to 20 miles a week and my wife use to run 10ish and do yoga 4 times a week. Now she is lucky to do yoga twice a month and I might get 30 minutes each week to run or ride. I'm kinda depressed, anxious about getting fat and catch myself slipping on my healthy foods. Wife feels the same. Im honestly just thinking about accepting my fate, buying larger clothes and just letting go. I dont want it but that's what seems to be happening."
So how you doing OP?,"I have for quite a while now. Thats not really the truth though. I do feel something. Fear. Im afraid of losing those I care about. Im afraid that Im not good enough. Even now, Im afraid that youre thinking Im being melodramatic when all Im really doing is trying to describe whats going on in my head. I know Im self destructive and I dont care. That makes me afraid of the person behind the mask I put on every day to face the world.I want someone to care. Anyone."
"It's what it's there for, and anyone you talk to would for sure have better advice than I would. If you're looking for unconditional love, all I can say is that the only unconditional love I've ever found came from Jesus. Best decision I ever made was to accept it.","She doesnt say I love you anymore, she doesnt even say hi or I miss you. It is as if I dreamed her and I am waking up from that dream again, and she was never real.I feel that I have been just dropped yet again, but this time I let my heart believe it was different. I trusted her promise to me. I have had only heartache for many years while trying to find someone to be with. I get hurt each time I let my heart believe. This time its different, I truly love her like no other before and I want to be with her, to help support her to help he with the stress of life, to be her partner in life. I want to go to sleep with her in my arms and wake up and her be the first thing I see in the morning."
"If you want to feel better about yourself, for yourself, you can always try new things like eating healthier, working out, trying new clothes, etc. You do you, unapologetically!","Hey guys. So Ive been struggling a lot with self-esteem when it comes to my looks. Ive had the same haircut since like 4th grade  (10th grade now) and get teased about it. About a month ago I tried something new, only to be made fun of for that. I ended up reverting back to my old hairstyle. Today i got a haircut (just shortened my hair, didnt change the style) and, once again I was made fun of, even by an adult coworker.

Im afraid that I wont be accepted or that people will treat me differently or like Im not normal if I do open up about this which is why Im deciding to ask a bunch of internet strangers in another sub that is more suited to my issue (sorry guys but this just isnt the right place for THAT encouragement) I really just need to be encouraged that it is ok to open up and dive into this self exploration. Im truly terrified of what others are going to say or do because of my upbringing (very religious, still am) and the nature of the subject at hand :/ I even went to far as to make an alternate account with a new email so my friends and family that use reddit cant find me on here and find out about this before Im good and ready to tell them."

My face becomes flushed and I also feel light headed.Internally Im freaking out but tend to express it through irritation and anger.

None of this is going to be forever.","I legit lost all of my friends in 2019 with not even the slightest explanation. Ghosted by my college friends when I had a family medical emergency and had to withdraw from school, and my best friend blocked me on everything in December. The only explanation I can think of for getting blocked is that she was hoping this guy (who she said had major insecurity issues) would ask her out, and my assumption is that he made her block me.Student loans are beating me down because I dont know if its financially worth it to shoot for my dream.

And that fact tends to extend to so many projects. I'm capable of doing so much art for others at huge speeds (commissions) and in that sense I'm super productive (multiple illustrations a day, even if rhey are small). I can easily sit down in the morning and producing art until before bed, but when it comes to my own stuff, it's almost impossible to just sit down and finish projects, be it an artbook, a plot, a comic, a game... I always end falling back into drawing commissions or illustrations, which I can finish with ease.It seems so many gamedevs or comic artists finished projects by the time they were my age or just a bit younger."

"I checked out your video, please don't doubt yourself! Everyone starts somewhere and you've taken that leap, you've already gotten the hard work started.","Ok so I'm pretty freaked out right now. Both because this is my first time posting, and because today I posted my first (and very rough) YT video.Some context: I live away from my family, they're in Indonesia and I'm in Sydney. I visit every year for Xmas, but this time it got sadder to go back to work after the holidays. I realised that I'd usually keep my head down at work for a whole year, and it started to feel sad and pointless. When I met up with a close friend while I was home, we talked about what really makes you feel happy, and singing is something that came up for as I felt it was like an outlet."
"And when you accept that fact, it changes your life.If you're worried that you're not the same person you were before the break ... everyone wakes up different than they were yesterday. Is that a bad analogy?","During the ambulance ride and for several hours afterwards I was hearing voices. My legs and arms were cuffed to a bed for the entire night. They position you in a certain uncomfortable position so you cant reach your hands close enough together to grab/use anything. I was so convinced that this was Hell, that I used my teeth to pull a cord coming from a nearby monitor and wrapped it around my neck to try to strangle myself.My sense of time became massively warped. It felt like I was in that hospital for 300 years. I eventually calmed down enough that they actually approved to release me. At first, I wanted to voluntarily commit myself somewhere, so they began the process of finding a location with availability. But I changed my mind after hearing a woman down the hall scream for hours on end. So I left.Since that time, I quit my job, I left the city, moved back to my hometown where my dad lives. Trying to forget.My town has a decent school, so I applied and was accepted."
"Just wherever you are at, there's no need to pretend you are somewhere else, just work on you where you are :). It's okay to not be okay sometimes, remember that.","Im a freshman in college and recently I moved about an hour away from home to attend school. The past few months have been absolutely dreadful, from moving in to an apartment to being late on rent every single month. My parents are separated so theyre always fighting over who should help me when money gets tight. Ive ran through about 3 jobs at my new location and cant seem to find the best job to keep me steady. I turn 20 literally on Friday and the fact that Im 20 with no stable income and barely getting by is killing my motivation and the way I want to handle things in life."
"Third thing I do is distract myself. Books, music and other simmilar activities occupy the mind causing You to very often forget the problem at all. On the last note I will add that if You were never to a psychologist, visit one.","This is going to also sound ridiculous, but my new phone (no case, no screen protector) somehow slid off the surface I placed it on while doing something this late at night, causing it to hit the hard floor screen first, getting itself some small scratches on its corners in the process. I know the scratches arent that bad, but my obsessive compulsive disorder really tests my tolerance when it comes to the smallest things. And it was a new phone that Ive only had for a couple of weeks, for crying out loud! Ive just been self deprecating for the past two hours, so far.In sum from all of this, how do I effectively diminish the thought of I could have done this to prevent this or that so I can learn from these small situations that have been bothering me for the past couple of hours? I guess I somehow have a compass as to how I can solve this, but hearing something from somebody else would really encourage me."

Slowly but surely I realized that it was taking time away from my goals when the whole reason I took the job was to put my goals first."

"You can make more coins by following the link up there, if funds has been your reason for worrying.","There is always a way out of whatever you found yourself in.At the root of worry, we find fear. In an effort to overcome that fear, we try to be brave, thinking that if we are brave, we can defeat it. Bravery doesnt replace or take away the fear in our lives; it just masks and gives us enough strength to act. If we want to stop living with fear, we have to replace it with something else: safety. The opposite of being scared is being secure. We need to stop trying to be brave and start being secure in our Creator. Being secure means we have the assurance and knowledge of being safe in Jesus arms. This assurance allows us to overcome fear. We gain this assurance as we grow in our relationship with Christ. As God becomes bigger in our lives, worry becomes smaller. The elevation of God in our lives helps us line up our values and put all other fears in their place."

A true friend will not leave you during the messed up times. For example my best friend made a dumb mistake and got 30 days in jail. Most of her family and friends who knew about it made her feel like a loser and not a good person.,The subject of our relationship status got brought up again and she said she was conflicted and part of her wants to just remain friends and part of her wants something more. I asked her if we could talk about it in person but we had to end up FaceTiming. It turns out all that flirting and leading on was her intentionally doing that to see if she was interested. What I took as affection turned out to be experimentation and at this point she was trying to avoid telling me the truth. Ive been rejected before but this one was different. She was leading me on for a month and a half and I thought I was really getting somewhere. The fact that she tried to feel that way for me and couldnt made everything worse. I know this may sound irrational but I cant help feel that there is something wrong with me and that Im screwed up and thats why this happened to me. Every time I put myself out there I get hurt and this one was a huge blow to the gut.

I know the scratches arent that bad, but my obsessive compulsive disorder really tests my tolerance when it comes to the smallest things. And it was a new phone that Ive only had for a couple of weeks, for crying out loud! Why couldnt I have placed it on the floor or on the counter instead? Ive just been self deprecating for the past two hours, so far.In sum from all of this, how do I effectively diminish the thought of I could have done this to prevent this or that so I can learn from these small situations that have been bothering me for the past couple of hours?"

When I mentioned it to people before hand I got ""it's super easy, you'll do great"" and then I failed and now I feel terrible. It seriously is making me sick rn. Everyone's response was just sorta ""oh that sucks"" The worst part about it is, I have made everything so much harder for my parents."

I desperately want to communicate this issue but she can already read it off of me (been together for a long time) which is making her mental health worse at times, and I think if we were to outright have that conversation it would cause her mental health to be even worse.

The future is not hopeless and you are not worthless.,"Not seeing future thanksgiving, or Christmas, not seeing that future life we said we both wanted. I die more each time I wake up from that dream life; the pain gets worse; my chest physically hurts right now as I am so heartbroken.I could live with her telling me its not working and she is breaking up with me, that would hurt but its the unknown, the not knowing for sure that she doesnt want me and the why. But I know logically silence is an answer, but how can someone say they love you then be so mean and just drop you from their life, that is not love.I would give anything I have to be held right now, just to be held, to feel wanted, to feel loved, and maybe even be together and remember what being alive means. I am going to try to sleep for a while, I am so tired, maybe my heart will just stop while I sleep and the pain of waking up wont happen, I can only wish it would happen."

I am on the fence about whether my husband and I should really be together. Sometimes I would rather be by myself and my thoughts than other people.

Due to being lazy in bed, I asked my dad to shake my lava lamp to let the floating hardened liquid to sink towards the bottom. He shook it too hard, causing the whole thing to fall apart and for the lightbulb to lose one of its connector pieces. He said hed go to the hardware store soon to replace the lightbulb, but Im in slight doubt if the lamp will work after that, feeling that its my fault, in technical aspects. If I had simply gotten up to do it myself, then my lamp would have been fine."

Odds are, whoever you date in high school will not end up being the love of your life.","Ive been feeling kinda down and ugly lately. If you check my profile, you would see that a lot of the recent stuff I posted is similar in idea. I really want to talk to my crush but it would never work out because hes way out of my league.

And he never does the precalc hw but he does great every test), hes humble (when I told him I got a hundred on my English midterm, he seemed genuinely happy even thought hes in much higher level classes than me), and hes fairly attractive.Ugh, hes probably the most mischievous little person around his friends and then hes nice- almost shy- with people that arent his friends.

I know the scratches arent that bad, but my obsessive compulsive disorder really tests my tolerance when it comes to the smallest things. And it was a new phone that Ive only had for a couple of weeks, for crying out loud! Why couldnt I have placed it on the floor or on the counter instead? Ive just been self deprecating for the past two hours, so far.In sum from all of this, how do I effectively diminish the thought of I could have done this to prevent this or that so I can learn from these small situations that have been bothering me for the past couple of hours?"

A true friend will not leave you during the messed up times. For example my best friend made a dumb mistake and got 30 days in jail. Most of her family and friends who knew about it made her feel like a loser and not a good person.,"On top of all this, I had a falling out with one of my best friends and he turned some of my other friends against me. I just cant help but feel like everything bad that happens in my life is a direct result of my actions. I had no reason to think that the girl I was talking to would have liked me in the first place. We were barely friends before but after I asked for her number we got really close. She said the reason she doesnt want to make our relationship anything more is because she doesnt want to destroy the relationship we have right now. I dont know how true that actually is. I want to be friends with her but I dont know if she honestly values our friendship or if that is just a load of crap to make me feel better. I feel like Im a failure and I feel like I hurt everyone I'm involved with. If youve read all of this I appreciate it and any advice is appreciated"

My heart sank....because....I'm the type of person who never buys anything for myself because I have always been broke.,So...Today I was planning on giving myself a pizza birthday with anyone who wanted to join on my campus. I only have two friends. I got a check for $100 yesterday that I cashed and I have been looking forward to this all week. Even after my birthday that happened this past Wednesday. I had some bills to pay like hulu and neflix which I didn't mind. But i made sure that I was saving enough to I could buy the stuff. I got on the bus. Got some drinks for myself and I got two bracelets from hot topic too but what I didn't realize was that most of my billing stuff happened today.

They position you in a certain uncomfortable position so you cant reach your hands close enough together to grab/use anything. I was so convinced that this was Hell, that I used my teeth to pull a cord coming from a nearby monitor and wrapped it around my neck to try to strangle myself.My sense of time became massively warped. It felt like I was in that hospital for 300 years. I eventually calmed down enough that they actually approved to release me. At first, I wanted to voluntarily commit myself somewhere, so they began the process of finding a location with availability. But I changed my mind after hearing a woman down the hall scream for hours on end. So I left.Since that time, I quit my job, I left the city, moved back to my hometown where my dad lives.

I desperately want to communicate this issue but she can already read it off of me (been together for a long time) which is making her mental health worse at times, and I think if we were to outright have that conversation it would cause her mental health to be even worse.

I studied my heart out, took 11 pages of notes on the driver's manual, and i thought i was ready. But I missed a stop sign and that's an automatic failure.

"First off, do what u/bookluvre said. However, if you can't find an online version of this school, just go for it. It will take a while but eventually you'll get used to getting up early in the morning. In the passing time when you're still dreading to get up, just make sure to drink coffee and do some kind of workout, whether it be taking a run or jog for a bit or doing jumping jacks. If you can't do all of this, u/sonjakate94 also provided good advice.","There's a reason I work the evening shift.

Well, a few days ago I had that again, along with a minor fever, but this time the symptoms have lasted several days. It is totally bearable, but I am just feeling really emotional and tired of being sick. Today my fever is a little worse, and on top of that, I'm in grad school and my current class has us reading several readings a day plus long blog posts.

Or do I reach a point in which I peak and then, no matter my discipline, I am condemned to go lower and lower, never doing as good again? Isn't there something I CAN do? Can it be a matter of attitude?

"Honestly, college is kinda rough and very few college kids are ""stable"" at 20. I was in your shoes in some ways.",I just feel like I have nothing going for me anymore. The only thing I can say Im motivated about is starting up my own kicking camp to teach high school football kickers the most important techniques and tips for training and in game situations. Besides that I cant find something to hold on to that would keep my head high and keep my motivation running. I just feel lost and empty and I wish I could ask for help but I know Ive already asked too many times. What are some tips you would have to keep a persons motivation running?
"Nor are we the product of daily struggle. Yet the same struggle give way to a uniquely human identity, your character.","I know my problems aren't worse than others. I know of all days today is definitely one of the easiest situations I've been put through in life. Today just hit me differently. I woke up really groggy and sleepy to get ready for work while worrying about my gf who has spine complications causing her endless pain. I tried to drive to work after pulling myself together but couldn't go because the road to get to my job was replaced by a ditch for construction.I have been raped, beaten by family, bullied most my life and jumped on multiple occasions. But today? Today feels so. Hard. I know I shouldn't be feeling sorry for myself but I really need a hand to be able to stand right now. I'm crying and have no idea why maybe it's just mood swings but everything feels awful and I don't know how to fix myself"
"First, please hang in there. Things will get better. Being 14 is can be very difficult and confusing.

If it ruins a friendship then it ruins a friendship but often people will respect you more when you set a boundary. You got this!!!!,"I guess Ill explain my situation. For about 3 months now Ive been talking to this girl. After our first date she said she didnt feel anything for me and so I tried to move on. After about a week of not talking to her she texted me asking how my day was. Since that day she started talking to me non stop every day. She then started to get kind of flirty and lead me on. When I talked to her about it, she said she was confused because she didnt feel anything originally and now she thinks things are changing. I was excited and so I just kept doing what I was doing and things were going great. Things went bad on Friday the 27th."
"I'm cheering for you, and I am inspired by your ability to self reflect and move forward with a plan that you believe is right for you, regardless of the opinions of those who don't believe in you.","College, the good and the bad:Theres really no easy way to say this and I dont want to beat around the bush by it and since I made the mistake, and I want to own it but, I remember it like it was yesterday, my sophomore and junior year, as much as I hate and am embarrassed to say it, I had a huge falling out when it came to school and life in general. It felt like every little thing I did, rubbed everyone the wrong way. No matter if I did one thing right, three four, sometimes six things would go wrong. Whether that be with school, friends, parents, or any other things. I got involved with the wrong crowd, not like drugs or anything like that but typical college things like partying and drinking. At the time it made me feel good inside and it took control of me and I let go of everything."
"I am richer with that experience. Second thing I do is talk to people about it, which You are doing right now. I even have a discord group that has a chat specificaly for venting.","This is going to also sound ridiculous, but my new phone (no case, no screen protector) somehow slid off the surface I placed it on while doing something this late at night, causing it to hit the hard floor screen first, getting itself some small scratches on its corners in the process. I know the scratches arent that bad, but my obsessive compulsive disorder really tests my tolerance when it comes to the smallest things. And it was a new phone that Ive only had for a couple of weeks, for crying out loud! Why couldnt I have placed it on the floor or on the counter instead? Ive just been self deprecating for the past two hours, so far.In sum from all of this, how do I effectively diminish the thought of I could have done this to prevent this or that so I can learn from these small situations that have been bothering me for the past couple of hours?"
"That is a step in the right direction and Im really glad you found people to help you. I am also glad you are trying the growth mindset.If I could make a suggestion, I would recommend finding a tutor for help if you are struggling with the material.","Sorry for formatting or mistakes, im on my phone and currently crying in the bathroom over first year university calculus, i opened up a ""quiz"" (can be tried as many times until we've gotten over 75% to unlock the current weeks videos) and i just exited out because the first question had me stumped. I havent done the homework yet, and I know that this isn't the way to go, i should havd done homework first to guage how well i know the material before stressing. But I've had this mental block all day, and just this mental block in general that I can't actually be confident in my math skills. And i always have this self doubt. I just have thus idea that I can never be smart in all things math, I'm trying to have a growth mindset but its so hard."

I never grew up in Philadelphia, I only have family that I visit when tragic things happen. During this argument, he states that he will move back to NY since I don't care about his feelings and that if I wasn't doing anything sneaky, I should answer or send a text to acknowledge him because acknowledgement only takes 2 minutes.

"Friend, I just want to say that I wish you the best of luck in your endeavor. As someone who also struggles with socializing I can tell you that it gets better. I hope you find friends that truly appreciate you. Maybe your project could be a conversation starter for making new friends. Thatll be a good way to make friends and find people for your project.","But most of the people around me seem anxious and not to know how to provide that sounding board. They wouldn't tell me to jump off a waterfall if it was actually safe and I was just scared.Another thing I could use encouragement on is a large project of mine, which I don't know how to start, because much of it requires social buy-in from others to get going. But also, in order for it to get going, it needs social buy-in. So I probably need to wait until I have more resources, but then there's this voice in my head saying ""why wait?"". So it's frustrating."
RemindMe! 3 months find this persons short film.,I am a struggling makeup student for 3 years and I finally got my first paid job for working on set for a short film. I was extremely anxious over it and stayed in a hotel for 4 days just to get some work experience which I never thought I could do this early on in my course. I did it and smashed it and I wasnt tagged in the promo post by the director who is also a student btw when he tagged everyone else. My parents werent too fussed either. I thought this was gonna be this massive achievement but now I feel like maybe I shouldnt feel so proud of myself as I am.

I am on the fence about whether my husband and I should really be together. Sometimes I would rather be by myself and my thoughts than other people. Sometimes my internal monologue is just really negative. Sometimes it just seems like too much to call a friend.

It may have taken him a little longer (He took the course twice) but he passed his exams last year to become an EMT and has been enjoying his work since. Hes now about to start his classes to become a paramedic. Dont doubt yourself, it maybe tougher but its not an impossible goal. Stick to your conviction and youll get there!","As the title says, I've been wanting to be an EMT for many years of my life but I've always doubted if I could because of a small learning disability that I have. It takes me a little longer to learn and memorize things so this always hindered me into becoming one. I guess I just need to hear some words of encouragement if possible.

share here!  i will give you the most positively worded feedback but still very honest.  hope i can help,"Hello, it's been a long-time secret hobby of mine to record myself playing instruments for fun, but i never had the guts to share my small projects with anyone close to me.

"Just building that habit alone will help immensely, even if it's just to the end of the road and back or a 5 minute walk.

My biggest concern is that I won't follow through with the promises I've made to myself surrounding this. Some good vibes would be much appreciated.
Just remember to enjoy yourself and find your calling. once you find your calling you can use it to direct your education to where you want to go. not sure if this helps but thats my opinion,"As I said, most of these classesare on sale due to schools trying to help either people who were laid off find new skills or people who are in quarantine find new hobbies, and they are usually between $10 and $25 each depending on the class.I ended up picking up classes to get certified in copywriting, dog training, and digital photography on top of what I mentioned above. I'm starting to regret picking up these new skills- like it feels like I'm trying to compensate or fill a void now.Am I biting off more than I can chew here? Am I doing too much? Is there such a thing as too much learning? Should I stop? I could just use a little direction and confirmation that this choice to learn more will not end up disappointing me in the future."
1. Is it mine? 2.,Ive been wanting to do this since last year but I just didnt have the right skills and financial stability yet.

Go to the math center. Go to test review sessions. Repeat.7. Make up your mind right now to destroy the next test. Study for it like the lives of your family are on the line.,Hi. I finished my original degree 17 years ago and have worked in IT since then but the past year had really made me fall out of \~\~love\~\~ like with that. I've wanted a masters for a long time with the idea that eventually I'd pursue a new career as a public policy analyst so I've gone back to undergraduate courses in economics and math with the idea if I do well I'll pursue a masters in economics but if not maybe public policy or political science or just go back to work. Of note I'm married with a 6 moth old daughter.Well...I showed up to my first calculus test (I originally passed it with an 89.6 in 2002 but am retaking it to prepare for calculus II) and the teacher told us we couldn't use our calculators and to put them away. We all panic. I didn't even finish the test.
You can do this. Say fuck you inner voice that tells me all the reasons why I shouldnt or couldnt accomplish my goals or take opportunities. That inner negative self talk is a liar and you can count on one thing for surewhatever it is telling you is the exact opposite of the truth.,"There's a reason I work the evening shift. I know this is a petty thing to get hung up on in the face of such an otherwise-perfect opportunity, but it's been a VERY long time since I've been required to get up early on a regular basis. And now I'm on medication with a side effect of insomnia. My current situation is unsustainable, and these early classes will allow me to stick with my usual evening shift; but I have a long history of being easily discouraged and can already feel myself backpedaling. I need someone to talk me out of talking myself out of this."

She was all serotonin deprived so I felt like timing was awful. But we have plans to make candles on Tuesday. I really feel that this might be something.

Then I get an email from my boss."
Touch. I'm definately one who is prone to being overwhelmed.,"A big question I think a lot of people are asking these days is why are we so depressed, why are we so anxious. We are more anxious and depressed these days because of our culture. With the internet and media we are under a microscope and we are constantly being pressured to be perfect. Perfect body, perfect skin, perfect routine, perfect eating habits, the way you sleep, the way the way you stand, the way you parent, perfect fulfilled fun lives. Every single thing we do we are pressured with the fact that we arent good enough. We arent doing it right. We arent doing it perfectly. We live in an illusion that some people are but its all just a magic trick. People put on a fake face. No one truly knows whats real anymore, so we sit there thinking we arent good enough, we arent as good as everyone else. We have access to all the bad news around the world like never  before."

You've got this!","Which as Im a senior who graduating in the fall, is just not possible to  do to jump start my possibility to meet at least what the average student does. I even looked at special masters programs and even non-master programs to help boost my gpa to somewhat offset myself but most masters programs I looked into required a 3.0, for me to take specialized test such as the MCAT, GRE, DAT, or more. Which was a concern to me cause the test are not cheap and require a lot of studying that was not possible to do before the deadline for applications.

I'm worried about what my coworkers think. I'm worried about pretty much everything to be honest. The list is endless. I guess what I'm asking is for some comforting words of encouragement that everything won't implode and even if it does it won't always be that way."
"If discussing your illness stresses them out, it's because they care about you.If I can offer any advice or encouragement, it's this: Recognize the times/situations where you sabotage yourself. This is a challenging area for me, personally.","I know that I can't work any more than 4 days a week with my current class load and my mental health issues. I can't get treatment now because I can't afford to pay for it. And I'd be lying if I didn't say I feel like the rug has been pulled from out beneath me. Maybe they thought I was doing better than I was actually doing. The truth is that talking about my illness stresses out my SIL. My brother offered to listen but every time I try to talk to him he just walks away. So I've only been telling them good things. Acting positive. Being positive about my job even though it's gotten dire.I'm just angry, sad and lost. I don't have any friends here."
"One day you'll look back on this time and say ""man, I DID THAT.""","Hi Reddit! I could use some encouragement. My living situation is really weird right now. Three days/nights a week, I live in a small city for my master's program. During that time,  I live in a house with this random older woman (she's nice, but still random) and a roommate. It's comfortable enough, but def not my home and I always feel like a stranger/guest. The other three nights a week, I live with my fiance four hours north in an apartment that we don't love in a town we both hate (it's super rural, we miss our families &amp; friends in another state, etc). So, half the week I'm at school in a weird living situation, and the other half I'm with my fiance in a weird living situation."
"Do it!! Honestly, if people disagree with you, thats their problem. You come first. I know this is late, and you might have taken the test already, but still. Dont hesitate to care for yourself.","I feel so weak. Im fighting back tears as I write this. My panic disorder has been so bad that its hard for me to even read a page. I have been postponing this exam because every time I try to study for it, the same thing happens over and over and over again. Its so stupid because I know I could do it, but when the time comes Im just a mess and I cant even get through a sentence. No, I cant even get through the title of the page. It is so frustrating that I know I could do something, but when it comes down to it, my brain just stops me. I didnt reschedule the exam this time because how many times am I going to postpone? I wish it wasnt so difficult for me to do things. Im so sad and heartbroken."
Some person youll never meet cares about how youre doing without having any agenda than wanting you to feel better in your head.,"I have always struggled with anxiety and depression, and the current state of the world has compounded it a thousand times over. Between street violence to cities burning to COVID and political corruption on all sides, I feel like the only future for America is a bleak one.

"All of my siblings are also extremely intelligent and I'm getting terrible grades. Also, look into getting an agenda. They help a ton with time management. And lastly always ALWAYS remember there are people in this world who love and care for you and if you were to die they would shrivel up.","my sister, on the other hand, is perfect and has almost all Bs and As all I have is one A and three Cs and a D in my grades. I can be very aggressive at times and I want to get better but I just don't know where to start and I need serious help with it I'm not sure what to do anymore ig. I've tried self-harm to make myself feel better and I've tried takin to God about stuff and he still gives no signs of encouragement and I just don't feel as if there's a purpose to living any more."
"I think you should apologize in person because it takes two people to fight, but I hope that you bring up better ways she can express herself to you when she's feeling down so you can help her more easily. I hope your talk goes well and I hope you are both doing better!","In the end she lashed out at me. I felt really bad and tried to apologize, but she is mostly ignoring me. I won't see her in person for another 3 days.I've been really stressed about this for the past few hours, and I can't help but feel guilty about it, even right now. With my self esteem and social anxiety issues, it is only getting worse. Can anyone please cheer me up a bit and give me some advice on how to properly apologize to her when I'll meet her again?Thanks in advance, and apologies for any mistakes in the post)"
"Focus on your purpose in life. You're 20, you're going to have a wonderful life. You've been through some hard times but your future will be so much better.","Im a freshman in college and recently I moved about an hour away from home to attend school. The past few months have been absolutely dreadful, from moving in to an apartment to being late on rent every single month. My parents are separated so theyre always fighting over who should help me when money gets tight. Ive ran through about 3 jobs at my new location and cant seem to find the best job to keep me steady. I turn 20 literally on Friday and the fact that Im 20 with no stable income and barely getting by is killing my motivation and the way I want to handle things in life."
"I don't know if this works in Canada, but I know for sure in the US you don't need a high school diploma to enroll in some two year colleges.","I still haven't graduated high school, never been to a college or a university, I have no training in anything, and I have no work experience. When applying for jobs those that are hiring don't care at all about my history they just see it as some big sob story or that I'm just lazy and didn't try hard enough. I'm going to try to get on Ontario Works (which is government aid) when my health card comes in the mail (have to have that to apply for Ontario Works, I don't know why but that's one of their rules.) So, I'll do that and I'll see what I can do about applying for work. Like I said before I really honestly do wanna work, I want to have a career I really do."

"I think you've been struggling because of those toxic relationships, I know from experience. bad people try to make you believe your meaning derives from them because they can't find their meaning. I bet you can find your meaning, all you have to do is get support from non-toxic relationships. its a lot like a plant, if it goes bad it cant recover but with a bit of fertilizer, it can sustain itself and no longer needs it. :D","I have struggled with Anxiety / depression since I was a teen and since the virus and being forced to quarantine I have lost most of my coping habits ( Gym, University, going to the beach, spending time with friends, seeing my therapist )   On top of that I have cut out of my life a close friend who was abusive, an Ex who came back for ill intentions, My half brother who was never there for me as kid, and i got rejected by a girl I've been crushing on for years. All of this timing is so bad and every day the few things ive been able to do to take care of myself have been eating healthy, going a run, and doing a tiny bit of homework, as well as spending tons of time on the advice subreddit trying to help others. I know i'll get through this, i know ill go back to being able to make myself happy without a need to feel complete from others."
"In the meantime, I'm sure your family is so happy to have a guy like you in it.You are prepared to capitalize on opportunities that come your way. You are doing the things in your control, even though you haven't seen results yet.","Today was a great day. I spent the day at Chuck E. Cheese's with my mother, little brother, and my 3 nieces. Bro and I racked up 5,000+ tickets for the girls to spend on prizes. Came home and finished up NaNoWriMo, getting in all 50k words a day early, even though this month was rife with days so full of depression I wanted to just give up on it entirely and binge watch tv or play video games instead.So actually feeling a little bit more productive than usual. Then I get an email from my boss."
"I joined clubs, I started talking to people on forums, I went to local meet ups.","I was always criticized by my foster dad growing up. I learned that sharing my ideas, interests and hobbies will always been seen as weird. It's made me struggle with talking to new people and even made me fearful for thinking about making friends. I have accepted the fact that I am seen as weird and that has made me socially anxious to make friends. I can't even look at a person in the eyes without thinking I look weird. I've grew up going through certain events that made me shut myself off from the world and be ashamed to share my interests and not know who I really am. I'm going to be 29 this week....And I feel like I have learned about things in life so late and that that makes me so under developed. I know though that I will get over it and that I will learn to accept myself and find out how I am but trying to break a pattern you have been dealing with for 27 years is the hardest thing I am going through."

Pay attention to the way you feel around people in your life.

Sometimes though I wonder if it's true and I get depressed wondering that (I do have medical depression, anxiety, and seasonal affective disorder.)

"Hey. give me a dm, would love to talk with you. I hear your pain and want to be another voice. Lets step away from the voices that add to our inner saboteur. Voices like his.

Weird question but can you think back to anything you can blame for when you started feeling like this,"Right now Im sitting in my dark and empty house and I dont know if I can do this thing called life. Ive been battling this demon for years now. No one knows whats really going on with me. Ive tried to talk to people about it but they all have the same carbon copied answers - Youre gonna be okay. Itll get better soon. Im sorry youre going through this. I dont think I will though. I know I need to talk this out with a professional, but I cant afford that or the insurance to cover it.

"Firstly your wife loves you, nobody is a better person to vent to than your SO.",Hi. I finished my original degree 17 years ago and have worked in IT since then but the past year had really made me fall out of \~\~love\~\~ like with that. I've wanted a masters for a long time with the idea that eventually I'd pursue a new career as a public policy analyst so I've gone back to undergraduate courses in economics and math with the idea if I do well I'll pursue a masters in economics but if not maybe public policy or political science or just go back to work. Of note I'm married with a 6 moth old daughter.Well...I showed up to my first calculus test (I originally passed it with an 89.6 in 2002 but am retaking it to prepare for calculus II) and the teacher told us we couldn't use our calculators and to put them away.

All politics aside, its just a really hard time to be a nurse. Long hours, frayed tempers, everyone is on edge. I'm just fried, and I miss my coping mechanisms of pedicures, massages, and spa days. They've been replaced by activities like hiking and meditation - its fun, but it's not what I really want. I come from a big family. We must update each other every week on how we have been. Negative points if you don't make the weekly Skype. Even more negative if you dont 'bring it'and show how you are 'crushing Covid.'I'm so tired. I have about 10% gas left in my tank.

Not a single soul. Early this year, I created a YT channel where I can start first by making covers before posting my own-----except that I am still too nervous to share it with others. The thought itself is nerve-wracking for me. Just now, I did try with a friend but it is still making me anxious.I know I need to let others hear my outputs because I need feedback to improve.

I love the outdoors in the summer, but with studying I've had little time for it.So basically I've given everything I love up for an entire summer and dedicated all my energy toward passing this test. I wanted to review this week, but I feel like I have nothing left to give and I'm impatient to get back to the things I love.

"I read the other day from adult redditors that even though college is portrayed as the best years of your life, they aren't :). That being said, here's practical tips:- Take little steps in the right direction. It isn't a race.","Im a freshman in college and recently I moved about an hour away from home to attend school. The past few months have been absolutely dreadful, from moving in to an apartment to being late on rent every single month. My parents are separated so theyre always fighting over who should help me when money gets tight. Ive ran through about 3 jobs at my new location and cant seem to find the best job to keep me steady. I turn 20 literally on Friday and the fact that Im 20 with no stable income and barely getting by is killing my motivation and the way I want to handle things in life."
,"A little over a month ago I was tossed out of my apartment by my now ex-girlfriend.  I was sleeping on my friends couch for a week, and then my job asked me if I wanted to travel to another location temporarily.  Originally it was supposed to be 30 days, but I signed another 90 day commitment so my total time out will be 120 days.  It has just sunk in on me that I'm effectively homeless, living out of a hotel room with nowhere to go.  Fortunately my job put me in the hotel and are paying for it.  I just need someone to give me words of encouragement."
well part of a colleges point is to try out many different things and possible careers. whether you can handle the workload is more your call. If your using it as a coping mechanism then possibly but as coping mechanisms go its a rather productive one.,"I'm struggling right now in many things. I have a bachelor of science in graphic design, but it's a popular career and I'm just not competitive enough. When my old job falsely accused me of assault, I got a certificate in technical writing to boost my chances at a new job. When I learned I might need to somehow move into a senior community to help out a friend, I got a certificate for in-home senior care so I could be his caretaker. Due to the pandemic, many certification classes are extremely cheap. So I picked up a photoshop class to boost my chances of a side job with graphic design even though the degree should technically cover it.Now I seem to have an ""addiction"" to getting more education and certificates. Im not spending $1000s of dollars for a class so its not like I'm ""spending money I don't have""."
"Its ok. You will get through this. First I applaud you for being in college. It may not seem like a big deal, but it is. Second, being 20 is when a lot of us were barely making it. My parents were also preoccupied and unsupportive but I learned to make it without their help. Look at all the good things you having going, and focus on how to be your best at what you are doing.

May you find good friends that truly appreciate you and may you live a prosperous life.","Hey,, i know it's usually people asking for advice around here, but i recently had a friend needing comfort when it came to talent,, and i think some people need to hear this,,,So, I'm 16. Not old, i know,, but I've seen more than most people at 20 have and im almost sure of it. I was raised in a very neglectful home,, and Im autistic, nonbinary and physically disabled to top it off. When i was younger, alot of my life was spent in isolation to avoid the sensory overloads or hate that came from being in public, along with the fact that i didn't fit in with anyone no matter where i went. My parents didn't bother to do much when it came to helping me,, only really talking to me if it had something to do with things they were angry with me about,,, so of course, i started wondering,, what is it that i dont have?"

"Believing that the resistance is all that there is can create fear. Fear of not being able to succeed because of your surgery. But wonder if you succeed because of your surgery? Give the resistance all your attention, as it is part of your process right now. Do not block it out.","I feel like I was on the cusp of finally getting my dream job (in the arts), but I had to take a long break due to a surgery that had complications. Now Ive been back at it for 2 months, and I feel like everything Ive worked for over many many years has gone out the window. Im doubting everything, I feel like I dont know what Im doing and I ruined my chances of succeeding. Things shouldnt be this bad after 2 months back at it, and Im embarrassing myself around my colleagues.  Ive never seriously considered giving up on this career path until now. I feel like Ive been trying so hard and for so long that this stupid surgery setting me back like this is too much to handle. Some words of wisdom or encouragement would really help me right now. Im struggling to see how this can possibly be made right."

Be on the lookout for them.","When I got home I should've done physical therapy. I was always active. I put on weight. 100 lbs. I tried to do call centers. Found out that years of emotional abuse had made it so I just sob when customers yell at me. Tried to go back to warehouse work but the pain in my legs, feet, hips and back was excruciating. Only lasted 3 months. Husband was the bread winner and I did literally everything else. All he had to do was bring home a check. I scheduled appointments, paid bills, cleaned the house, planned meals, grocery shopped, etc. I was already doing that while also working. It was nice to only do one side of it. We bought a house. 1 month later my husband lost his job of 7 years. In the 2 years since, he has worked a total of 5 months. We cashed out his 401k. It lasted a year."

Just today I was at the gym not 10 minutes ago and a couple of super skinny super hot girls just snickered at me. Part of it's probably because I'm paranoid but I feel like they were saying look at the fat girl trying to be like us Jesus Christ she doesn't f****** belong here. And so I ran home. I don't know if I can keep going to the gym and having those negative experiences. I'm just to anxiety-ridden and depressed to not go to the gym but at the same time when it's making those symptoms worse... I don't know I just need some encouragement."

I'm 28 and I haven't found a solid career. My new job has offered to pay for classes to get my LTP as I work at a tax firm.

On top of that, her mental health has been beyond terrible for herwhich is likely a huge driving force for the dependencyand Ive gotten Caregivers Fatigue 3 or 4 times already. I desperately want to communicate this issue but she can already read it off of me (been together for a long time) which is making her mental health worse at times, and I think if we were to outright have that conversation it would cause her mental health to be even worse.

"Good for you for going to continue your education! I can relate to going back to school after a long break (didn't go back until my late twenties).

I used to read and crochet. I do almost nothing that I did before I became a mom and now its like everything is about my son and if its not then I feel like a bad mom.

The thing about this university is that there is no project work, no presentation or participation points to help my grade- EVERYTHING is based on the results of a year-end exam. Last year, I failed ALL my modules and had to resit them, which makes me one year behind. This year, I managed to clear two of my toughest modules, but I failed the other two, which means that I now will take 5 years to graduate.My parents and friends are telling me not to beat myself up over it, but I can't help but feel so, so disappointed that I did not pass everything. I had such expectations for myself too.I guess I really feel insecure about graduating a lot later than everyone else I know. I feel really depressed that I can't do well in something that I like."

"Friend, Im sure he appreciates the support you give him. As for encouraging yourself, I would recommend a therapist as that therapist probably has the best advice for you.As for encouragement, perhaps listen to how your boyfriend encourages you.

"I believe in you and your capability to one day become a doctor. Nursing could also give you a unique perspective on medicine, which is something that will set you apart from other applicants when you decide to apply. You've got this!",":Around July I applied to a masters in biomedical sciences at NOVA. This was a specialized program in Florida aimed to help student with below standards to boost their application into medical school or dental school. You needed a minimum of a 2.5 gpa to apply and this was my last chance to get into medical school as if you got in and completed the program you were able to receive an interview to their medical school. Which in my eyes was a good thing because a lot of people apply and most dont get interviews. Well if I could cut the curve and gone to interviews then I beat more than the people and had a higher chance. However I ultimately didnt get accepted. So I decided it was time to not necessarily stop my dreams of medical school, but rather but it on pause and do something else for a bit and if the cards play out, reapply to medical school later down the road. Focusing and narrowing down to what I liked to do best, I found myself pursuing nursing."

It does sound to me like this would be a perfect conversation to have with a licensed counselor and I really encourage you to consider doing that first.

,So...Today I was planning on giving myself a pizza birthday with anyone who wanted to join on my campus. I only have two friends. I got a check for $100 yesterday that I cashed and I have been looking forward to this all week. Even after my birthday that happened this past Wednesday. I had some bills to pay like hulu and neflix which I didn't mind. But i made sure that I was saving enough to I could buy the stuff. I got on the bus. Got some drinks for myself and I got two bracelets from hot topic too but what I didn't realize was that most of my billing stuff happened today.
Hey friend. Im sorry you had to experience that. I really hope things get better. I noticed you said you had friends you turn to.,"Sorry for formatting or mistakes, im on my phone and currently crying in the bathroom over first year university calculus, i opened up a ""quiz"" (can be tried as many times until we've gotten over 75% to unlock the current weeks videos) and i just exited out because the first question had me stumped. I havent done the homework yet, and I know that this isn't the way to go, i should havd done homework first to guage how well i know the material before stressing. But I've had this mental block all day, and just this mental block in general that I can't actually be confident in my math skills. And i always have this self doubt. I just have thus idea that I can never be smart in all things math, I'm trying to have a growth mindset but its so hard."

"You are the inspiration so many others need. You have the support of an army of warriors behind you, you are not alone.","Just need a little encouragement. A man threatened suicide when I told him I no longer wanted to date. I helped him get help and when I thought the situation deescalated, I left. He since has sent numerous texts and emails. Finally, he sent a 4-page letter to my house claiming that I caused all of the anxiety, depression, and desire to end it all. I filed a PFA (protection from abuse) against him. He is an abuser and its going to take a lot to be in the same room as him tomorrow - and to listen to him make up his version of reality, and to fight the protection I am seeking.I am hoping against hope that the judge believes me and is willing to grant this order to give me some peace of mind."
"Another great resource is possibly talking to a doctor if you are able to, maybe getting a referral to a therapist or possibly taking medication to aid you.","I know Im young, Im under no delusions that Im fully mature and that this is it, but I cant shake this feeling that Ill NEVER shake this.

My family (heavily Baptist) havent found out and I dont plan on telling them for as long as possible. Same story for my bf only worse. I worry for him, what if they find out? What if it ends?

And he never does the precalc hw but he does great every test), hes humble (when I told him I got a hundred on my English midterm, he seemed genuinely happy even thought hes in much higher level classes than me), and hes fairly attractive.Ugh, hes probably the most mischievous little person around his friends and then hes nice- almost shy- with people that arent his friends.

I encourage you to keep trying and to maybe pursue that idea when you feel healthy enough to do that, but in due time, there is no rush.","I made an appointment at a behavioral health place nearby, but my first impression was not good. I want to be honest when I go in to seek their help, so I imagine whoever is tasked with speaking to me will find that helping me will be a challenge. I dont want to play nice. This is serious. Ive had a therapist for years, someone who I deeply trust and believe in. But I think not even someone of her caliber can help me now.I dont know what to expect from an online community like this.

Due to being lazy in bed, I asked my dad to shake my lava lamp to let the floating hardened liquid to sink towards the bottom. He shook it too hard, causing the whole thing to fall apart and for the lightbulb to lose one of its connector pieces. He said hed go to the hardware store soon to replace the lightbulb, but Im in slight doubt if the lamp will work after that, feeling that its my fault, in technical aspects.

I asked him how was my tone and he couldn't tell me.&amp;#x200B;The recent dispute happened when I told him he could not have $1000 from my refund check.

I left that crowd behind, I gained control over alcohol and I actively pushed for my education cause at the end of the day I know I had a goal in mind of becoming a Neurosurgeon or just getting into D.O or M.D. school.

This implies that people will live for thousands of years. According to Revelation 21:1-4, God will turn his attention to mankind, and one of the promised blessings is that death will be no more for people serving God in his righteous new world. Adam and Eve lost Paradise back in Eden, but it was not lost forever. As God promised, people on earth are yet to be blessed."

We lose out on something which was very dear to us, when our identity is lost, hope also takes a backseat and we are left hanging just to be tossed around by the unprecedented consequences, like in this Covid. This begs some fundamental questions, where does your identity lie? What things are you putting your hope on? Weve seen and understood clearly nothing is permanent. This diminishing hope is very insecure and can cover our mind with anxiousness and fear."
"Youre probably not going to get the job just by looking pretty and blinking your eyelashes, you get it by doing hard work. And youre in luck! If youve been in management/high positions before, then youve certainly worked hard, no? Work hard and ou shall receive (most times)! Youve earned this. Dont worry about the what-ifs because thats out of your control atm. Focus on the new job, focus on the new possibility. You got this.","I've been in a serious dark phase for quite some time now, with L's fucking up everything from my health to my marriage.

I should have this.Today, I toured the property, shook hands I'll see, and got filled in on essentially the importance of MY job. Not gonna lie, in that elevator, I started to sweat... But when I walked away, I was flushed with 'Fuck yeah!', ya know?"
"You nailed the thought there.  That doubt is self-sabotage.  I agree with the other commenters: go the extra-thoughtful mile, and don't worry.  You have no control over how she'll receive the gift, so just do your best and be yourself.  (And besides, if she's into you then she'll appreciate you being authentic anyway!  Honesty is the only foundation for a solid relationship, my dude.)  Go get her. =)","I've got the chance to return the favor, but it's not under quite the best of circumstances; She's got a surgery scheduled for this week, and while it's not major she's said she's still really scared (Can't blame her). Add in her having a bout of the flu and she's been in a pretty bad place the last few weeks.I decided to get her something to cheer her up and settled on making her cannoli (I saw from a FB post of hers that she liked it) and spent the last few days carefully finding out her favorite flavors and any food allergies she may have without directly asking her. I've got my recipes and all my ingredients, but my brain (Which is very good at self-sabotage) has come up with an outcome I'm having trouble dealing with."
"There's more to do, yes, but I think it's obvious when you sing that it comes from a place vibrant and wonderful, and there's nothing better than that. Best of luck, you can do it!","Ok so I'm pretty freaked out right now. Both because this is my first time posting, and because today I posted my first (and very rough) YT video.Some context: I live away from my family, they're in Indonesia and I'm in Sydney. I visit every year for Xmas, but this time it got sadder to go back to work after the holidays. I realised that I'd usually keep my head down at work for a whole year, and it started to feel sad and pointless. When I met up with a close friend while I was home, we talked about what really makes you feel happy, and singing is something that came up for as I felt it was like an outlet."
"Im not saying you should give your whole life into this career, but I am saying that if you want it that much, do not give up on it.Im confident in your abilities.","I feel like I was on the cusp of finally getting my dream job (in the arts), but I had to take a long break due to a surgery that had complications. Now Ive been back at it for 2 months, and I feel like everything Ive worked for over many many years has gone out the window. Im doubting everything, I feel like I dont know what Im doing and I ruined my chances of succeeding. Things shouldnt be this bad after 2 months back at it, and Im embarrassing myself around my colleagues.  Ive never seriously considered giving up on this career path until now. I feel like Ive been trying so hard and for so long that this stupid surgery setting me back like this is too much to handle. Some words of wisdom or encouragement would really help me right now. Im struggling to see how this can possibly be made right."

"Don't just quit bud! I think you have the passion and drive to become a personal trainer. It may be that a corporate gym might not be the best setting to start off given that it's such a small clientele, and you wouldn't be getting as much experience.

This is inspiring.,"They ripped those pieces I'd worked so hard for out of my hands and kicked me to the dirt. And from then on, the prices got bigger. I learned how to paint, i became the soloist of my choir, i learned to cook. Nothing was enough. Eventually, i even started offering money or items for love, and even my body. At 13, i was desperate enough to give up my BODY for some company. And it wasn't until i was 15, still alone and in misery, having attempted suicide 7 times in my life, that I realized something.The only thing worth living for was the enjoyment i gave up. I gave up my life for talent."

My current situation is unsustainable, and these early classes will allow me to stick with my usual evening shift; but I have a long history of being easily discouraged and can already feel myself backpedaling.

"First of all, that poem is pretty good. Second of all, I understand what you mean when you say you lack self control.

A lot of your time is spent marketing. Getting yourself out there. Im curious what you have done to do that? Are you linking your channel on similar websites/forums? What work are you putting into driving clicks and subscribers?,"is this bad and i just can't see it? is my dream of being a vlogger and being free as a bird too crazy?could you guys give me some feedback? this is something very near and dear to my heart, it is what i pour most of my time and energy in, i decided to not go to college because i thought i could do this successfully.the past few months i've really been putting a lot of effort into dialing in my target audience, the value proposition, the message and i'm still perfecting it, but it's starting to come to life.What does my channel communicate to you, both by its design and messaging?what vibe does it give you? what type of content do you think it is?"
You only fail your dreams when you give up on them. If you truly love the art and stay driven then you will be successful! Now... on to the next project!,I want to go into the film industry with the goal of being a screenwriter/director or possibly even an editor. Honestly I'm open to anything within the film industry if I enjoy it. I know it's a super hard field to go into but its the only thing that I have ever been passionate about in my life. I graduate from college in less than two years and have no clue what to do after. I'm thinking about moving to California but it scares me. I know that I have a big chance of failure but I also know that if I don't pursue this career that I will regret it for the rest of my life and will always think about the what if. I guess I'm just looking for somebody to say it'll be alright and don't give up. Thanks!
"I don't have any real advice, but I also struggle with this issue. Hugs from me to you. ","I just had a rather horrid binge, and this has been a problem Ive been dealing with ever since childhood.

Science, however, holds its promises as long as its a skill-based field.","I've taken on a 3-year university course that is said to be really tough, but it's something I'm truly interested in. The thing about this university is that there is no project work, no presentation or participation points to help my grade- EVERYTHING is based on the results of a year-end exam. Last year, I failed ALL my modules and had to resit them, which makes me one year behind. This year, I managed to clear two of my toughest modules, but I failed the other two, which means that I now will take 5 years to graduate.My parents and friends are telling me not to beat myself up over it, but I can't help but feel so, so disappointed that I did not pass everything. I had such expectations for myself too.I guess I really feel insecure about graduating a lot later than everyone else I know. I feel really depressed that I can't do well in something that I like."

I got a check for $100 yesterday that I cashed and I have been looking forward to this all week. Even after my birthday that happened this past Wednesday. I had some bills to pay like hulu and neflix which I didn't mind. But i made sure that I was saving enough to I could buy the stuff. I got on the bus. Got some drinks for myself and I got two bracelets from hot topic too but what I didn't realize was that most of my billing stuff happened today.

They're really different but my old boss was abusive and careless to his employees and I couldn't take it anymore. I went back to a place I had worked before and I also love it for different reasons. I'm 28 and I haven't found a solid career. My new job has offered to pay for classes to get my LTP as I work at a tax firm. It's really tempting because I would get to stay here with people I love and the pay would be great but my old job was working with kids which i love more. I want to continue working with kids but I would need to go back to school to have jobs that pay enough.I have anxiety and all of this change and stress has been getting to me.
Everyone makes mistakes! Be kind to yourself.,"I'm such an idiot. Normal online classes are on Mon and Thurs but this introductory session was on Wed (yesterday for me). I misread the email.

It might be weird next week when I show up out of nowhere without having been there for the first session. Well, hopefully I can email my professor and hope and pray I don't get kicked out or something. Please encourage me; I'm really feeling down right now, also because I know my parents will not be too happy with me."
"100% a great step. Mothering is such a bucket emptying activity - you give everything of yourself to your offspring and they cannot wait so that you can care for your own needs at the start. It really is about finding ways to make space for yourself happen and its a great step to reach out to a friend!!As an introvert it is hard for me to spend so much time with other people, and I really need to have alone time to be better as a mum.","Im 7 months postpartum and having some trouble getting over PPD. Lots of crying lately and being overly sensitive to little things that wouldnt typically bother me. I guess just feeling pretty insecure personally. Also not feeling like myself- I used to do a lot alone like go to the mall, the movies, out to eat. I used to be very tidy and organized. I used to read and crochet. I do almost nothing that I did before I became a mom and now its like everything is about my son and if its not then I feel like a bad mom. Anyways, I just reached out to a girlfriend of mine and asked if she wouldnt mind going out for dinner so I could start trying to get out of the house.

"You are strong and life will get better with time but you need to find a clear direction to aim for that as you are not defined by her.

You can do it and I believe in you!","TL:DR at bottomFor 16 years Ive been alive and most of it I loved. Only when I left my house that is, I have a single mother parent who emotional abuses me calling it parenting. I tell her I love you so I can get alone time (I dont actually mean it) if I dont say anything to her she goes off ranting through out the house and calls relatives to give them false stories, I thinks, and so forth thinking her assumptions are correct. Its gotten to the point that the only things keeping me sane at this point are my two little brothers knowing if she does kill me (shes held knifes and hammers to my head and neck) my little brothers will have nowhere secure to go to. Im starting to crack under the pressure I just need people to talk to.TL:DR Im a victim of emotional abuse under the disguise of parenting and the only thing keeping me together is my brothers.

I feel horrible for them. Do you think they know and are sad?I started a new job (with my same company, but a lot more responsibilities) two weeks ago. I just started a new medication (Zoloft) last week before the breakup happened. There is so much happening and I don't know what emotions are caused by the breakup...or the medicine...or school or the job.I know it will get better...but how can I be ok enough now to focus on school and work? I feel so sad and scared and I'm just really struggling, but I don't want to give up now. I'm sorry that I'm complaining so much. I know I am very fortunate in many ways. I wish I could just focus on that and let go of all of the pain I am feeling.Thank you."
So many thoughts of experience and wisdom i just dont know where to start. First you are not the reason for being alone.

We were barely friends before but after I asked for her number we got really close. She said the reason she doesnt want to make our relationship anything more is because she doesnt want to destroy the relationship we have right now. I dont know how true that actually is. I want to be friends with her but I dont know if she honestly values our friendship or if that is just a load of crap to make me feel better. I feel like Im a failure and I feel like I hurt everyone I'm involved with. If youve read all of this I appreciate it and any advice is appreciated"

I'm starting to regret picking up these new skills- like it feels like I'm trying to compensate or fill a void now.Am I biting off more than I can chew here? Am I doing too much? Is there such a thing as too much learning? Should I stop? I could just use a little direction and confirmation that this choice to learn more will not end up disappointing me in the future."

I finished my original degree 17 years ago and have worked in IT since then but the past year had really made me fall out of \~\~love\~\~ like with that. I've wanted a masters for a long time with the idea that eventually I'd pursue a new career as a public policy analyst so I've gone back to undergraduate courses in economics and math with the idea if I do well I'll pursue a masters in economics but if not maybe public policy or political science or just go back to work. Of note I'm married with a 6 moth old daughter.Well...I showed up to my first calculus test (I originally passed it with an 89.6 in 2002 but am retaking it to prepare for calculus II) and the teacher told us we couldn't use our calculators and to put them away. We all panic. I didn't even finish the test.

Today i got a haircut (just shortened my hair, didnt change the style) and, once again I was made fun of, even by an adult coworker.

I think it's brave of you to admit you need someone to love and care.,"I have for quite a while now. Thats not really the truth though. I do feel something. Fear. Im afraid of losing those I care about. Im afraid that Im not good enough.

They've been replaced by activities like hiking and meditation - its fun, but it's not what I really want. I come from a big family. We must update each other every week on how we have been. Negative points if you don't make the weekly Skype. Even more negative if you dont 'bring it'and show how you are 'crushing Covid.'I'm so tired. I have about 10% gas left in my tank.

The roast me reddit reminds me of a scientific study I read about taking delight in other peoples suffering and failures. This also contributes to the difficulty of spreading kindness,"I just realized something discouraging.  r/RoastMe and other forums dedicated to negativity are freakin' massive (1.2M?!).  Disproportionately large compared to r/encouragement or whatever is trending the opposite way.Is it more difficult to do good in this world?

Just today I was at the gym not 10 minutes ago and a couple of super skinny super hot girls just snickered at me. Part of it's probably because I'm paranoid but I feel like they were saying look at the fat girl trying to be like us Jesus Christ she doesn't f****** belong here. And so I ran home. I don't know if I can keep going to the gym and having those negative experiences. I'm just to anxiety-ridden and depressed to not go to the gym but at the same time when it's making those symptoms worse... I don't know I just need some encouragement."
I'll also add - my wife once said she'd never in a million years date me. I was her best friend for years and she couldn't imagine romantic feelings for me. Now we are happily married with a kid.,"I really need a girl in my life to help me, I have a more sensitive side that I'm showing now that needs to be vented.

Idk what you believe in but I believe that something is there and its good and it will guide us if we let it. I think its guiding you to something better.,The subject of our relationship status got brought up again and she said she was conflicted and part of her wants to just remain friends and part of her wants something more. I asked her if we could talk about it in person but we had to end up FaceTiming. It turns out all that flirting and leading on was her intentionally doing that to see if she was interested. What I took as affection turned out to be experimentation and at this point she was trying to avoid telling me the truth. Ive been rejected before but this one was different. She was leading me on for a month and a half and I thought I was really getting somewhere. The fact that she tried to feel that way for me and couldnt made everything worse. I know this may sound irrational but I cant help feel that there is something wrong with me and that Im screwed up and thats why this happened to me. Every time I put myself out there I get hurt and this one was a huge blow to the gut.

Due to being lazy in bed, I asked my dad to shake my lava lamp to let the floating hardened liquid to sink towards the bottom. He shook it too hard, causing the whole thing to fall apart and for the lightbulb to lose one of its connector pieces. He said hed go to the hardware store soon to replace the lightbulb, but Im in slight doubt if the lamp will work after that, feeling that its my fault, in technical aspects. If I had simply gotten up to do it myself, then my lamp would have been fine."
"If possible, try to talk to her (dont argue, dont raise your voice). Maybe even say your sorry tell her youre scared about the future too.","These past 4 days have been awful and I don't know what to do anymore. It all started on Thursday ( some context I'm 16) I got a call during school lunchtime that my best friend Jay(18) had been arrested for assault, he had beat his sister's  abusive boyfriend half to death so I'll probably never see him again but then an hour later I hear from my good friend John that my friend Mike(15) will be moving out of state because he got his girlfriend pregnant. Oh and not being able to see 2 of my friends wasn't enough I got pulled into the counselors office and told that I will be repeating earth science and that I will be taking a course over the summer."

Sometimes, every so often, I am actually happy. I think. But the demons always come back. I'm so tired of living this way. It effects every facet of my live. I've lost jobs, friends, relationships etc. It seems the only way to keep the demons away is to just cease to be here. I've had another fairly bad episode this past week and I'm worried about my job. I'm worried about what my coworkers think. I'm worried about pretty much everything to be honest. The list is endless. I guess what I'm asking is for some comforting words of encouragement that everything won't implode and even if it does it won't always be that way."
Sometimes life doesn't work out the way we wanted it to and it's okay because everything works out the way its supposed to. Take care of yourself and work your hardest to only move up from here on. Maybe getting a GED or finishing your high school credits are the first step.,"Now, when my parents homeschooled me there wasn't much information about it and not a whole lot of people did it, it just wasn't as common as it is now. There wasn't as many curriculum's then as there is now and the curriculum's weren't as advanced as the one's now. So, anyways when my parents pulled me out of school I was in the 5th grade but after testing me on a few things to see where I was, most of what I knew was a kindergarten level maybe grade one. So, it was very hard work but I did catch up, although unfortunately because my Autism (it's not my parents fault, they honestly tried and so did I) I wasn't able to do the work required of me to graduate. There were subjects I just couldn't grasp and understand at the time. So, I wasn't able to graduate high school."

But the best is yet to come, seriously :).","Im a freshman in college and recently I moved about an hour away from home to attend school. The past few months have been absolutely dreadful, from moving in to an apartment to being late on rent every single month. My parents are separated so theyre always fighting over who should help me when money gets tight. Ive ran through about 3 jobs at my new location and cant seem to find the best job to keep me steady. I turn 20 literally on Friday and the fact that Im 20 with no stable income and barely getting by is killing my motivation and the way I want to handle things in life."
"Could you ask her for help managing your time? That's an ongoing lesson imo, I don't know if anyone has perfect time management - no matter how old they are.

"I hope the pain subsides for you and I hope you feel better soon. You can overcome this. It wont be easy, but its definitely possible.

"I think you're right in line with today's focus. Management by deliverable has always been one of my favorites. I'm in IT, and when you let programmers have freedom,mwith only a deadline to meet and no 9 to 5 grind, they are free to work at midnight or whenever they want to.

It's a bummer you don't have the support you would like to have. Those closest to us often don't want us to change or don't believe we can.The good news is there is nothing they can do to stop you from putting in the work to achieve that dream.,"I have a shitty job and a very unsupportive family. While having dinner, I told them about my plans to leave my full time job and build my own career on freelancing. Not even a minute in my explanation and theyve already bombarded me with a lot of questions and doubt. I know freelancing is hard like really really hard but its something that makes me happy (I currently have a part time job which is essentially what Ill be doing as a freelancer) and I know starting from the very beginning will be extremely hard but Im mentally prepared for it. Ive also saved enough money to live for a year which Im confident that Ill be able to get clients by then. It just hurts to know that none of the people I consider the closest to me support me in what I want to do. Its seriously taking a toll to my mental health."
BUT I FUCKING WAS LIKE I PAID ATTENTION AND IT WAS STILL NOT ENOUGH. Good luck and please don't rush. Everyone is different. And there is nothing ashamed of being seen crying. Letting it out is better than holding it in. Deep breath kk,"Hey, 18 F here. I have pretty bad anxiety and i finally got the courage to schedule my driver's test a few weeks ago. I studied my heart out, took 11 pages of notes on the driver's manual, and i thought i was ready. But I missed a stop sign and that's an automatic failure. I never even saw the damn thing because there was a tree branch in the way, and ended up missing a second one because I sort of went into a panicked state and shut down. When I parked and the lady told me a failed, i started bawling and I ended up crying all the way home and for a few hours after that."

She wouldn't let me move on to the elite choir, though I auditioned every year and had a high score. My friend let me see her scores, and they were so low and she got in. I tried to do the local vocal competitions twice, and both times she would flake on my time slot for practice and then eventually advised me to withdraw from the competition. I moved on to college.

Im happy he still wants me. Im afraid he will stop one day. Im still doing everything. Cooking, cleaning, planning meals, doing odd jobs for money.

I've refrained from telling them out of fear of being disowned.

My ex-girlfriend is the only person who knows I'm not Christian. I plan to tell my parents when I get to college, and don't have to live under their roof anymore.I'm hoping that college will be a new start for me, where I can actually be honest and connect with other people, but for the next few months, I'm alone and stressed.

The caveat is that youre feeling great to be free of the tyranny. My point here is that part of a job is going out of your way to preempt the kinds of problems that end up becoming intolerable. Get back on the horse and find something else.,"This job lasted just short of year an a half when I found out I would be let go under the new buyers of the hospital due to changing certification standards. Mind you I hated this job so this wasn't a bad thing, I was excited. I immediately hoped on indeed and applied for a position at Super Supplements just to get a job. I do enjoy health and wellness so why not? I'm also getting my NASM Personal training certificate and could use an easy side job. I initially started this job April of this year and at first it was incredibly easy being back in retail. Then due to a series of events it got incredibly difficult. No working registers for 4 months, no support from managers, and co-workers who didn't like me. Slowly but surely I realized that it was taking time away from my goals when the whole reason I took the job was to put my goals first."

Neither of them fit me, as I was much larger than I anticipated. As of two weeks ago, I was finally able to wear the dress out in public and wore it for D&amp;D!2) This morning, I hesitated to try on the corset, fearing that I was still too large. Eventually, I gave in. I pulled on my thick long-sleeve shirt and held the corset over my head."

I recall drawing my face and writing, nose job, mole removal, lip injections, hair needs to be blonde.

Especially if her mental health issues are impacting you in a negative way. And dude...be kind to yourself. I know that may seem so hard right now but make sure you're not being too hard on yourself.,"Ive been on a downward spiralMy fianc and I have moved in together at the start of 2020, which either highlighted or exposed some major dependency issues that she has. On top of that, her mental health has been beyond terrible for herwhich is likely a huge driving force for the dependencyand Ive gotten Caregivers Fatigue 3 or 4 times already. I desperately want to communicate this issue but she can already read it off of me (been together for a long time) which is making her mental health worse at times, and I think if we were to outright have that conversation it would cause her mental health to be even worse. She also gets upset that it seems like I view her as helpless and unable to function without me, and admittedly I do because shes so extremely needyI hate myself physically.

I haven't been feeling too well lately I was throwing up and had a really low blood pressure due to anxiety ups and downs and I injured a part of my back on my birthday today and could hardly walk because of all the pain.

Lean on people you trust and talk through your frustrations. Do not let yourself believe that you have to do this by yourself. You don't and you're not alone.,"I'm feeling really low. A few months ago on I was promoted to my first management position. I was so excited to be In leadership and I really thought I could make a difference in someone's career.

After rigorous training almost all of them are rough, to be expected of course.What I wasnt expecting is to have 4 HR issues right of the bat and them escalating me to leadership above me. I have 3 that are are written warnings for attendance, 1 more and will be termed. 1 went to my leadership and asked if I was right. Unfortently I so know this may happen as people might be unhappy, especially if they are having performance issues. All day my leaders tell me that i have such a bad team and they feel so bad for me, that I'm doing great handling it and it's really breaking me in."

I was always active. I put on weight. 100 lbs. I tried to do call centers. Found out that years of emotional abuse had made it so I just sob when customers yell at me. Tried to go back to warehouse work but the pain in my legs, feet, hips and back was excruciating. Only lasted 3 months. Husband was the bread winner and I did literally everything else. All he had to do was bring home a check. I scheduled appointments, paid bills, cleaned the house, planned meals, grocery shopped, etc. I was already doing that while also working. It was nice to only do one side of it. We bought a house. 1 month later my husband lost his job of 7 years. In the 2 years since, he has worked a total of 5 months. We cashed out his 401k. It lasted a year."

Due to being lazy in bed, I asked my dad to shake my lava lamp to let the floating hardened liquid to sink towards the bottom. He shook it too hard, causing the whole thing to fall apart and for the lightbulb to lose one of its connector pieces.

I get enraged and start verbally attacking him as soon as I see him. I say everything possible that was on my mind and more all in front of his family. I totally lost my entire cool. He never admitted any wrong doing even after I told him what I saw with my own eyes and claimed I got what I deserved because I went through his phone. He only admitted to entertaining the females after I told him that it was over.&amp;#x200B;Incident 7We traveled to Niagra Falls for a quick getaway date hour.
I was so nervous but the audience response was incredible. Then I couldn't wait to do it again.,"Hello, it's been a long-time secret hobby of mine to record stuff for fun, but i never had the guts to share my small projects with anyone. Not a single soul. Early this year, I created a YT channel where I can start first by making covers before posting my own-----except that I am still too nervous to share it with others. The thought itself is nerve-wracking for me. Just now, I did try with a friend but it is still making me anxious.I know I need to let others hear my outputs because I need feedback to improve. How do you think I should go about this? I hope it's okay to ask on here. :(Thank you in advance!"
"Friend, Im sorry you have to deal with this. Just know that there is nothing wrong with you in this case. Jobs can be hard to find. I hope you do find a job and I hope youre able to live on your own if thats possible.","So I go, not far from home but not close either, 16 years old moving out when all youve known and seen is your hometown is scary and it took a while but I got used to it, but there I just felt even though their trope was that you could fit in anywhere, I felt more alien than ever before and not myself, I loved off my humour and cracking jokes and being a spastic making people laugh and to be in a place where I felt I was alone but had so many people around me living along side them, it just didnt fit, now people got used to each other people made friends and so did I but I just felt alien to everyone else, now I do have things Im proud of in there, I picked up an injury so missed a lot of lessons so having picked up a rifle for the first time on a Wednesday and having to take it into a test and passing first time on a Friday was something I was surprised i was good at, a zooming through an obstacle course as the others looked on shocked on how good and fast I was getting through it was a feeling Id never felt before, but I knew it wasnt right and at least wasnt the right time, so I left halfway through training."
"I hope you find a job soon, and I hope it treats you well.What Ive learned from my experience is that when it comes to jobs, if the work environment is good, then youll love the job. Its no so much the field as it is the environment. So my advice is to choose a job with a good environment for you. Then youll learn to like the job.","I don't want to get married and have kids (I'm not against those things, I just don't want them) and I don't want to have to do that simply because I'm female and Autistic. I feel the need to prove even if it's just to myself that I'm capable of more then cooking, cleaning, and making babies. I want to achieve my dream of being independent and having a career. I just don't know how possible that is, or even if it's possible at all. I had so many dreams as a kid of things I wanted to be when I grew up. When I was very young I wanted to be President Of The United States (I didn't know that as a kid born in Canada that one had to be born in U.S.A to be the President but I was a young kid.) I dreamed of being a lawyer or having my own business and owning a corporation."

"If it is finding a hobby and practicing it at least a few hours or an hour a week, do that.) And if you fail from time to time, like humans are known to do, that's okay, just keep going and trying again until it gets easier and you can move on to whatever is next.

Seven years later i meet a great man who loves me for my good and bad. He lets me rant over death of penmanship and how its a lost art.,"On top of all this, I had a falling out with one of my best friends and he turned some of my other friends against me. I just cant help but feel like everything bad that happens in my life is a direct result of my actions. I had no reason to think that the girl I was talking to would have liked me in the first place. We were barely friends before but after I asked for her number we got really close. She said the reason she doesnt want to make our relationship anything more is because she doesnt want to destroy the relationship we have right now. I dont know how true that actually is. I want to be friends with her but I dont know if she honestly values our friendship or if that is just a load of crap to make me feel better. I feel like Im a failure and I feel like I hurt everyone I'm involved with. If youve read all of this I appreciate it and any advice is appreciated"
if he's ignoring you for a week then ask him what he's been up to. a true partner would let you know he's okay,"Last we talked, he promises to come see me, didnt show up and didnt even bother to communicate. Ive gathered up some courage to call today to see where were at but Im super nervous. Please encourage me to do this... thank you!"
"Go nuts, add more than 2 maybe? Alright, alright, not too much detail.Drop a nose or three and some other appropriate orifices. Make it as silly as you want, just put confident lines down. Go back and shade it if you want.","I want to learn to draw, speak Japanese, try and get some episodes transcripted, and write, but I can't get myself off my phone or out of bed and doing anything.

"Almost everyone has been there at some point! Stick in there bud, theres nothing you can do about the sour people in the world. More importantly, dont change who you are for those people. Keep your head held high and know that youre better and more mature than that.","My ears stick out super far, and the young kids I work with say I look like an elf. I have major bags under my eyes due to a type of insomnia, and my face is unsymmetrical when I examine it.At this point its just a struggle to deal with all these things. Im fairly popular but still face social anxiety, especially when talking to girls, due to my low opinion of my looks. I could really use some encouragement. Any and all is welcome. Thanks guys :)"
"Dude you're freaking amazing.  I'm considering working two part time jobs along study, but even that will be tough, and I'll probably drop one.  I think as long as you have a day to yourself a week, with no responsibilities, you can tough it out for a while.  Make sure you write regular,  achievable goals for yourself and hit them hard!","I work 3 jobs right now, and am part of a mentorship program. I could just work the one and pay my bills. I just have such bigger dreams than where I am now. It's just fucking exhausting. I just need to know it'll be worth it."
"We love you, Calico.  I promise things will get better.Is there a counselor at your school you could talk to?","Literally, the only thing that is keeping me together at this point is the internet. People encourage others and make people laugh, even though you don't know them. Under all the craziness of school drama and life, I can still find some good online. Anyway, I just need some tips on how to get my dad's words out of my head, or at least a link to a funny meme to cheer me up or something. I just need to stop overthinking all the stuff he yells at me for. I'm not good at explaining stuff, so can you just throw some comments at me? It seems like I'm just asking for attention, and now that I think of it, I probably am. I don't get any in real life, so let's just see if some random people online care!:)  why did i write this"
"If that means getting up early to do a hobby before work, or read a book at night, or something that you enjoy, just try to do that for you.

"Breathe. Take a nice, long, calming breath, maybe take a walk. Talk to your Aunt; start with something small or relatively less private and see how she reacts. If that goes well, continue to talk. Explain that you just need a break, that you feel like shit.","im 19, ive been arrested twice for marijuana. once when I was 17 and then again when I was 18, it was over a year ago and im still going to court for it. yesterday I sat in the court room for almost 5 hours just for them to give me another court date. I broke down and started ugly crying in front of the prosecutor. it was so frustrating. I went to rehab in april. I was bad off on xanax and I overdosed. but it was on purpose. my dad kicked me out, so I moved in with my great aunt. shes nice. but I dont feel like I can talk to her.

For once can I be treated right.. do I not deserve anything good in my life? Am I not deserving of love? Is there something wrong with me? Am I unloving.. I need encouragement that its gonna be okay because I have no one else.. Please help me.
Find ways to surprise her and give her joy as a friend.,"So, I've been best friends for a year and a half with a girl(I am a guy) and I'm talking the kind of friendship that we can tell each other anything and everything and know that the other isn't going to judge and is just there to listen and give advice.In November I finally told her that I had feelings for her after debating in my head for 4 months. She said she also had feelings for me and we were proud of each other for finally letting it out. However, ever since then it feels like there is a rift in the friendship that I had zero intention of creating, you see, I never fully wanted to get into a relationship as she had just started her freshman year of college and I am in my Junior year of highschool(we're only a year apart in age) so we were both stressed with school."
"You are right about the current state of the systems here in Canada, the minimum wage workers can not afford to live and this entire country is car dependent. And yes Covid is reeking havoc on mental health all over the world.","I'm really scared living in Canada and being poor and mentally ill.I suffer from neurological and mental disorders and have always had trouble keeping work. I'm in an affordable city ( Montreal ) but really want to go, but everywhere I look it all seems even more expensive than it was.Toronto is not doable, Hamilton has gone up a lot too. I could really only afford a shared apartment on minimum wage ( if I could keep the job ) and disability isn't enough for a 1 bedroom either. Living with others can be very stressful, of course not as stressful as being homeless, I know I was once for a short time.I just feel so depressed being poor and mentally ill in Canada, like the raising rent and costs of food, ect makes it no longer a place for poor people, minimum wage workers."
But my point is there is no question that you can absolutely crush this class.2. It just takes time to get back into the rhythm of classes/homework/test prep. You need to corner your teacher after class and get clear expectations for what problems you should be drilling and what will be on upcoming tests.,"Well, I just got back my grade and it's a 37/100 and I'm panicking thinking this was all a mistake quitting my career to go back to school just to try and find a career I was actually passionate about. I'm enjoying learning but failing that bad has me in panic mode. I already struggle with depression and I'm hoping to benefit from talking with someone about it. I don't feel like I can talk to my wife about it.:("
"When you find yourself in these situations try to pop into an observer mode. Imagine a four foot wall of jello around you. When people throw their doubts or other negative emotions and energies at you, walk up to the wall and look at what they have thrown at you and as yourself two questions.",Ive been wanting to do this since last year but I just didnt have the right skills and financial stability yet. Now I know Im ready but it feels like its dragging me down with all the doubt that my family has around me. I easily get affected by what other people tell me which sucks big time. Im currently organizing my portfolio and other starting a freelancing career stuff right now and feeling really depressed. Uplift me please? Im close to breaking down.
"Of course it's not enough, but it helped me.","I just had a rather horrid binge, and this has been a problem Ive been dealing with ever since childhood. Its hard for me to be kind to myself after I decided to stuff my face to the point of getting sick instead of looking after myself. Does anyone have kind words to offer? Thank you for taking the time to read this. I sincerely appreciate it from the bottom of my heart. "
"I think you have the right idea, focusing on the things you are grateful for, but I think we still have to go through the pain. I seems so recently you went through a huge painful change in your life. It will take time to process it. I find that practicing gratitude is helpful, challenging at times, but helpful.","I am taking my dog and one of our cats. I feel horrible for them. Do you think they know and are sad?I started a new job (with my same company, but a lot more responsibilities) two weeks ago. I just started a new medication (Zoloft) last week before the breakup happened. There is so much happening and I don't know what emotions are caused by the breakup...or the medicine...or school or the job.I know it will get better...but how can I be ok enough now to focus on school and work? I feel so sad and scared and I'm just really struggling, but I don't want to give up now. I'm sorry that I'm complaining so much. I know I am very fortunate in many ways. I wish I could just focus on that and let go of all of the pain I am feeling.Thank you."
I would go for it. You'll kick yourself if she ends up with someone else and you never said anything. The worst that can happen is she doesn't feel the same.,Ive known this girl (Im a guy) for a while now. I really like her but I just cant muster up the courage to ask her out. I dont know if I should go do it.
!,"I have for quite a while now. Thats not really the truth though. I do feel something. Fear. Im afraid of losing those I care about. Im afraid that Im not good enough. Even now, Im afraid that youre thinking Im being melodramatic when all Im really doing is trying to describe whats going on in my head. I know Im self destructive and I dont care. That makes me afraid of the person behind the mask I put on every day to face the world.I want someone to care. Anyone."
"You didnt know and now you do, simple as that. It was an honest mistake that probably wont amount to anything. Your co worker should be more understanding. You are a new employee who wasnt trained in that specific type of request. I hope everything went well. ","I wasn't sure what they meant at first, and so they clarified. The company had an account with us so I pulled it up and saw there was no money in the account. I totally fucked up and told the girl that the account had a 0 balance and that she won't be able to cash the check and she needs to call her employer. It turns out, the only thing  I'm allowed to say is that the funds are not available (in the account). So I had just revealed private information.I called a coworker over to help me figure out what was going on and when the call ended he gave me this 'I can't believe you did that/You were not supposed to do that' face and said that I shouldn't have revealed the account balance and that all I was supposed to do was verify whether or not funds were available. I felt so stupid, because honestly this is how we verify other funds for people who aren't customers."
"Things may be tough right now, but they won't always be. Try taking that test again, I'm sure this time it'll work out wonderfully. Things will start to look up for you, I have a good feeling. I believe in you! :)","Hey, 18 F here. I have pretty bad anxiety and i finally got the courage to schedule my driver's test a few weeks ago. I studied my heart out, took 11 pages of notes on the driver's manual, and i thought i was ready. But I missed a stop sign and that's an automatic failure. I never even saw the damn thing because there was a tree branch in the way, and ended up missing a second one because I sort of went into a panicked state and shut down. When I parked and the lady told me a failed, i started bawling and I ended up crying all the way home and for a few hours after that."
"Thank you for reaching out. People are here for you. There's people who understand, and I think you've found/or will find them.Take one thing at a time, like taking a walk outside.

So after I bought drinks and two cool bracelets for myself, I didn't have enough money to buy my pizzas. I was at target and I had put two digornio's stuffed cheese pizzas in my cart and I was trying to check my bank finances cause I always get paranoid that money is going to disappear. But I had $40 after I bought my bracelets. So I knew I had enough....but when I saw I only had $8. My heart sank....because....I'm the type of person who never buys anything for myself because I have always been broke. I have been scammed out of money through my parents. I have had precious items sold from under my nose by family.....I once had a $100 electoric guitar and $50 amp bought for christmas one year....I didn't even have that for a year."
"Friend, dont be sorry for ranting. And dont feel like you wasted anyones time. You are not a waste of time, and you are not worthless. I would highly recommend a therapist.

We sat there talking about the possibilities for an hour straight.I got overwhelmed and needed to cool off in their bathroom. I was looking at myself in the mirror, and I could feel my brain pulsating and *moving*, like it was rewiring so rapidly that it was causing a physical sensation. Ive never felt anything like it.I suddenly felt enormous guilt. It was as if the universe was angry with me. I had opened Pandoras Box. I was this underaccomplished loser that barely achieved anything noteworthy in my life, always felt like a disappointment to my family, and here I had just stumbled across something that could change the world."

My little brother(technically brother in law) started riding his dirt bike in May. He loved it, we were out there with head lights some nights.

While he was in his cast he was itching to get riding again and when he finally got the chance to he was on his bike within an hour of being given the ok. A few hours later he went down hard again. He escaped with a bruise, nothing broken."
"Hey my friend. I'm sorry it has been so rough today. And you know what? I think it's okay to feel sorry for yourself. It sounds like a lot of people haven't given you the care you needed, but it also sounds like YOU are caring for yourself, and that takes courage and guts and strength. It's okay to get tired. It's healthy to be honest about it. And, we are rooting for you and sending you love","I know my problems aren't worse than others. I know of all days today is definitely one of the easiest situations I've been put through in life. Today just hit me differently.

Their doubt is not true.,"I have a shitty job and a very unsupportive family. While having dinner, I told them about my plans to leave my full time job and build my own career on freelancing. Not even a minute in my explanation and theyve already bombarded me with a lot of questions and doubt. I know freelancing is hard like really really hard but its something that makes me happy (I currently have a part time job which is essentially what Ill be doing as a freelancer) and I know starting from the very beginning will be extremely hard but Im mentally prepared for it. Ive also saved enough money to live for a year which Im confident that Ill be able to get clients by then. It just hurts to know that none of the people I consider the closest to me support me in what I want to do. Its seriously taking a toll to my mental health."

Thank you for taking your time to read this thread. I've put a post onr/randomactsofkindnessrequesting people to send a card/postcard/letter with uplifting/heartwarming words to my boyfriend (in Vancouver) who's PTSDs and depression.Here's the content I've written in that post:We've been together for three years. He's now living in Vancouver and has been waiting for an available therapist/counselor/psychologist to help him since February (very likely that he's been too apathetic to actively seek professional help or to do follow up check work for seeing how the waiting list is going from time to time). He's broke, and his physical health isn't good. He also wears hearing aids.Last year in October he experienced something really awful. The torture was ""finished"" in November.

Often times when I decided I would do an ADN at a smaller university I would fill out the applications only to find out I would need more classes because a lot of my classes wouldnt transfer from UAB which helped in my GPA aspect but meaning more time before I could actually sit in a nursing program. That being said with a miracle of luck, I found this joint program with a community college that actually partners with UAB to allow you to get your ADN and BSN at the same time. Its 5 semesters long and I meet the requirements to apply and submitted my application to start in the spring."

Then I get an email from my boss."
,I cant do it. When Im heartbroken I get really bad depression. Im taking medicine for it but it still hurts. For once can I be treated right.. do I not deserve anything good in my life? Am I not deserving of love? Is there something wrong with me? Am I unloving.. I need encouragement that its gonna be okay because I have no one else.. Please help me.
"I'm on mobile and I'm lazy and there is 6 people that look at this thread so I update in the comments... but thank you you 6 people.

"And if no one else loves you, know that I love you and I think you're amazing.",I have a mild/severe lisp and a double chin (f genetics) I think Im ugly and really I have few people that I can compare to that are remotely as ugly as I am. COVID lost any social status I had (not like I had any from high school but) I have literally at school 0 ZERO friends just a few people trying to befriend me for stuff. I also have a writing disability and I tend to stutter and be annoying talking and overtaking the conversation (that can sometimes be good) but yeah I wanna rebuild my life from ground 0 any help?
"Geology looks promising for you. Especially considering it's something you're passionate about. It's certainly been on your mind for a long time. How would you feel if you aged and didn't decide to pursue this dream of yours? Do you think you'd feel safe, knowing that you decided not to spend the money on tuition? Or do you think you'd regret not going for it?This seems like something you really want. So, go for it! Don't do yourself a disservice by trying to be safe. Safety is really not really ever promised anyway.","I've been away from school for a few years dealing with personal things and now I'm finally deciding to go back. I have a lot of doubts and insecurities about how much money I'm spending on a degree that might not actually do me any good, especially since I took a few years off from getting it. But this is not a decision I'm making lightly, and it's one I've spent many many nights thinking about. It seems every time I bring up these fears with people they advise me to keep waiting until I'm sure, or to think about getting a different degree."
"I have been in a similar situation, PTSD, had to live with my brother but it was for a limited amount of time.  You're doing the right things and it's tough. It will get better.  Making mental health treatment a priority and quitting drinking helped me get to a stable situation on my own.  Never feel like you're alone.","I'm so lost. I moved back home (3 states away) to move in with my brother (and his wife and toddler) when my previous job stopped paying the bills. I was told to take my time, do what's right for me, and not to leave until I actually had money in savings again. I am taking a computer course that ends in an apprenticeship in June/July. I have a waitressing job 4 days a week. The money has fallen to $60/shift in tips plus a paltry $4/hr. It's a daytime waitressing position, as I have the tendency to become extremely unproductive during the day and drink to excess when I'm off at 10pm or later. It's happened countless times.Beyond that, I find it nearly impossible to live with a stranger. The last two roommates I have had that I didn't really know have ended badly. This is why I moved in with my brother and his family."
"You can get through it. I believe in you. Baby steps are still steps forward. Stumbling is okay, it happens to everyone. And you are not weak to ask for help. If you have any friends or family that you are close to and trust, I am sure they will be more than willing to help you. You can do this","Asking for help, whether it was in my childhood when i was weak and I knew that I would only want more, or now when I believe it creates a dependence, always ended up being angering or overbearing for the helper and I knew it whether they wanted to show it or not. and no-one wants to help a weakling or a arrogant person, so here I am waiting for myself to do something. perhaps just a word or two will do, because you cannot be me or care about me all the time and I know that, and I am not asking for that. I dont know this community and I dont intend to join it, but I will thank you nonetheless because thats all I can do in return. thanks"
Find ways to surprise her and give her joy as a friend.,"So, I've been best friends for a year and a half with a girl(I am a guy) and I'm talking the kind of friendship that we can tell each other anything and everything and know that the other isn't going to judge and is just there to listen and give advice.In November I finally told her that I had feelings for her after debating in my head for 4 months. She said she also had feelings for me and we were proud of each other for finally letting it out. However, ever since then it feels like there is a rift in the friendship that I had zero intention of creating, you see, I never fully wanted to get into a relationship as she had just started her freshman year of college and I am in my Junior year of highschool(we're only a year apart in age) so we were both stressed with school."
And Im sure most religions / faiths would align with this. Be respectful of yourself and others but own who you are.,"Please just encourage me to begin this self discovery and take the steps I need to help myself figure out who I am truly. Sorry for the long read, but thank you in advance!(Ps, I think Im more insecure because I tried to do this once before with the wrong group of people and they totally brushed me off in order to bring the spotlight to their own self and their issues instead and Im scared of that happening again)"
"Its unlikely to have a lasting affect, but maybe next time you could feel her and say oh yeah I know what thats like, and then give your situation so that way you guys can relate to each other instead of compete with each other.","Hi, I'm pretty new here on Reddit. Anyway, I've been really sick for about a week now. Because of it, I've mostly been staying at home.My best friend regularly texts me from school and cheers me up. We have a really great relationship and almost never argue with each other)But today, she texted me out of nowhere, saying that ""I wish I were in your place"", and kept talking about how I had it easy and how stressed she was, unlike me.I was honestly really surprised, considering she knew how bad the pains from my illness are. I told her that my position is not perfect either and that I didn't wish her the pain I had."
Friend. Im sorry you have to deal with this. I hope you do find a job soon. I especially hope your managers wont be as flaky as the previous ones. Im impressed with the amount of experience you have. I hope it helps you,"I do have a lot of anxiety so cold calling, and calling back multiple times (especially when they have ignored me once) makes it super hard. I don't have a lot of people I can talk to because I don't want to bug my friends and family anymore. I'm always complaining about the same things... I am trying to find a therapist, but we only have coverage for maybe 2 or 3 visits. I'm trying to find someone who will work on a sliding scale because 2 visits isn't enough and I want to stick with the same person if I like them. Anyway. Not sure if this is in the right place.... Just needed to vent. TL DR: followed partner to city for his job... Quit mine...  can't find one. Now I'm jobless and sad."
"(Sorry for no sources, if someone knows better please correct me.)You can definitely do this and there are a ton of things busy and drained parents have found to cope.","I recently got married, then my wife and I decided to foster, then we moved. All within a year and a half. We both use to be so active almost every day. I understand parenting is a priority but with this current child we literally cannot get out of the house. It's just too hard. I use to ride/run up to 20 miles a week and my wife use to run 10ish and do yoga 4 times a week. Now she is lucky to do yoga twice a month and I might get 30 minutes each week to run or ride. I'm kinda depressed, anxious about getting fat and catch myself slipping on my healthy foods. Wife feels the same. Im honestly just thinking about accepting my fate, buying larger clothes and just letting go. I dont want it but that's what seems to be happening."
"Awesome!  Good to celebrate the successes. =DAs an aside, FWIW, my wife (who's a dietician) says that regular meals are important -- the tendency to skip meals is actually counterproductive, even with restricted calories.  Your body will think it's starving and will hoard every calorie.  Healthier to keep to three small meals on a regular schedule than only one or two per day.Congratulations on your success!  Would love to hear updates in the future. =)","At the start of 2019, I was 190 pounds. This was the result of emotional eating, then starving myself years after I left a sexually and emotionally abusive relationship.One of my family members suggested her Paleo diet. All she eats is meat, and she lost over 20 pounds (good for her). If she eats anything else, though, she gets hella sick.I didn't want to give up my love of food, so when I met up with my girl friends from university, one of them said she was starting a calorie-limited diet and asked if I wanted to join her. You bet your sweet southern ass I did!We limited our calories to be around 1200 calories a day. A lot of days, I had little food, so I ate as much as I could to satisfy my stomach, even though it was 400-900 calories."

"I know that money might be an issue for you now though, but if there's any way you would be able to pull it off then I would absolutely suggest doing so. I would very much recommend trying to have your Fianc do the same if she's not already.","Ghosted by my college friends when I had a family medical emergency and had to withdraw from school, and my best friend blocked me on everything in December. The only explanation I can think of for getting blocked is that she was hoping this guy (who she said had major insecurity issues) would ask her out, and my assumption is that he made her block me.Student loans are beating me down because I dont know if its financially worth it to shoot for my dream.

"I'm cheering for you, and I am inspired by your ability to self reflect and move forward with a plan that you believe is right for you, regardless of the opinions of those who don't believe in you.","Despite meeting everyone and anyone about my next step, no one seems to care too much and just tells me to leave the health care field out of my head and focus on something like HealthCare Management or business.

"I'm so sorry things are tough right now. I wish I could give you a big hug. I hope things turn around soon for you. Something that helps me when things are tough is to find one thing (big or small) that I enjoy, and do that. For me right now, it's baking. But maybe you like coloring, or reading, or talking to your family on Skype. Maybe finding something you find joy in and have access to might lift your spirits just a bit. I hope this helps.","Im in too low of a funk to consistently care about maintaining my beard which is as frustrating as daily care would be.

I hate when I get like this because I'm very draining when I'm this symptomatic. Some of them have stopped picking up the phone, which is understandable. I guess I'm just asking for any encouragement on this situation. I don't even know how to take my first step forward. I have been crying almost all of my waking hours since about 10pm last night. Any advice/encouragement for a mentally ill 35 year old who needs to start moving forward? I'm so tired. TL;DR: I'm 35, have a crappy job, but I'm working towards a better one.

During this time from Wednesday to Sunday, I am uncomfortable and nervous. I am under the impression that I''m allowed to leave by myself but not with my son. He finally agrees that the hurricane is no longer a threat and that I could go home. I did allow him to see my son, and try to co-parent like he wished but after picking up my son on Tuesday morning and experiencing how my partner was still being aggressive with me, I finally realized how my emotional and physical safety was at risk.I called the police and reported the domestic dispute and he was eventually arrested and forced to do anger management.&amp;#x200B;After everything had happened, I decided to reconnect with him and try again. I knew this was a bad idea, but I wanted a family and I wanted my son to grow up with family. BIG MISTAKE. As soon as this happened, day by day, my partner was showing his true colors again."

In my normal non-school life, I play games like Guitar Hero, Tetris, and StepMania (I'm good at them), watch YouTube videos, look at Tumblr, browse Reddit every once in a while, and ignore my Twitter notifications.The reason why I even use Tumblr is because of Pokemon (specifically Vaporeon, he's my favorite). I found an ask blog from a google image search and now I look at posts from blogs that I follow.

You're tough as hell and done so much. Not to be platitude-y but it seems like you can do anything you set your mind to!

I was always active. I put on weight. 100 lbs. I tried to do call centers. Found out that years of emotional abuse had made it so I just sob when customers yell at me. Tried to go back to warehouse work but the pain in my legs, feet, hips and back was excruciating. Only lasted 3 months. Husband was the bread winner and I did literally everything else. All he had to do was bring home a check. I scheduled appointments, paid bills, cleaned the house, planned meals, grocery shopped, etc. I was already doing that while also working. It was nice to only do one side of it. We bought a house. 1 month later my husband lost his job of 7 years. In the 2 years since, he has worked a total of 5 months. We cashed out his 401k. It lasted a year."

I don't know if I can keep going to the gym and having those negative experiences. I'm just to anxiety-ridden and depressed to not go to the gym but at the same time when it's making those symptoms worse... I don't know I just need some encouragement."

In the passing time when you're still dreading to get up, just make sure to drink coffee and do some kind of workout, whether it be taking a run or jog for a bit or doing jumping jacks. If you can't do all of this, u/sonjakate94 also provided good advice.","I have a part-time retail job which admittedly I love, mostly because of an awesome manager.

I won't have that life that I had for that day.","I want to do all the things we talked about doing, the bucket list of family adventures.I dont know that I will get over this breakup, not even sure it would be called a breakup more like a harsh dump from her. I am of no value anymore, I don't even have enough value to say goodbye to.

We get back to his mother's house and she can tell something is wrong with me. So, I ask to speak to her one on one to show her what he did to my phone. Instead of letting me talk in private he intrudes on our conversation and starts antagonizing me telling me that I don't know how to keep my mouth shut and our business is between me and him. He starts to berate me again and follow me throughout the house and outside."

I could really only afford a shared apartment on minimum wage ( if I could keep the job ) and disability isn't enough for a 1 bedroom either.

So many thoughts of experience and wisdom i just dont know where to start. First you are not the reason for being alone. If your friends jumped ship that quick and didnt take the time to know your side of the story then they arent your friends.,The subject of our relationship status got brought up again and she said she was conflicted and part of her wants to just remain friends and part of her wants something more. I asked her if we could talk about it in person but we had to end up FaceTiming. It turns out all that flirting and leading on was her intentionally doing that to see if she was interested. What I took as affection turned out to be experimentation and at this point she was trying to avoid telling me the truth. Ive been rejected before but this one was different. She was leading me on for a month and a half and I thought I was really getting somewhere. The fact that she tried to feel that way for me and couldnt made everything worse. I know this may sound irrational but I cant help feel that there is something wrong with me and that Im screwed up and thats why this happened to me. Every time I put myself out there I get hurt and this one was a huge blow to the gut.

"If you are struggling mentally I would suggest seeking an academic advisor or a therapist for help.

Its just a bit jarring to have such a sudden lapse in communication, and I just want to message her more. Im gonna call it a night, whether she answers my question about a TV show or not. Dont want to hit her with the let me know if Im talking too much shtick, because the last thing I want is to show weakness. Im still feeling insecure about it, as she didnt reply to any of my prior comments except for the very last one. Shes trying to comment, I can see that.

I desperately want to communicate this issue but she can already read it off of me (been together for a long time) which is making her mental health worse at times, and I think if we were to outright have that conversation it would cause her mental health to be even worse.

I know this is late but I actually searched for this subreddit because I am a little discouraged atm with my progress is the industry.,I want to go into the film industry with the goal of being a screenwriter/director or possibly even an editor.

I know that I have a big chance of failure but I also know that if I don't pursue this career that I will regret it for the rest of my life and will always think about the what if.

"Focus your energy to the good and the good will grow. Let people laugh if they want, but why let that decide your future? Whatever happened in the first few acts, the finale is ahead.I look forward to seeing your performances.=)  You can do it.","I felt good for once. I felt I grew into my looks and I trusted my family would still help me with the surgeries because only then, maybe I could seek their approval for my dreams.There were many times I would say my dreams aloud and people would tell me they wouldnt happen. They claimed Im average looking and nothing special. It didnt make sense to me. How could people openly be so rude? I would go home and stare at myself... re-counting the trauma of bullies and also, the remarks of my family claiming that surgery would make me a goddess.Heres the thing: I told my family again age 18 I was saving my money for LA and I planned to set out to model and act. The whole table let out a huge roar as if Bernie Mac made the best joke ever... so much laughter, pointing their fingers, laughing with unchewed food in their mouth. You an actress? You dont even have the looks!"

"I'm cheering for you, and I am inspired by your ability to self reflect and move forward with a plan that you believe is right for you, regardless of the opinions of those who don't believe in you.","For too long now, I have felt like nothing I was doing was helping me. I just need some help and seeing if I officially meet the requirements and seeing what I need to do. Why nursing?:As I mentioned before my passion and my driven mood is in the medical field. One of the most remunerating parts of a role in nursing is the capacity to associate with our patients on such a close level. While we frequently meet under exceptionally troublesome conditionsbeing available as individuals face genuine wellbeing difficulties or wounds, seeing the snapshot of birth or the finish of lifewe become more acquainted with our patients rapidly and have the chance to assume a significant function in their lives. I turned into an attendant so I could affect the lives of others and have a role that felt important.Why not dental, pharmacy, or any other career?I have looked into each of these careers and more but my whole academic career was based around being a medical school student. Ranging from classes to volunteer hours."
"Do soul searching. Just know your limits. Depression can be rough, don't stay in the house for bouts on end if it'll throw you into a rough patch. Watch what you're feeding your brain.","Today was a great day. I spent the day at Chuck E. Cheese's with my mother, little brother, and my 3 nieces. Bro and I racked up 5,000+ tickets for the girls to spend on prizes. Came home and finished up NaNoWriMo, getting in all 50k words a day early, even though this month was rife with days so full of depression I wanted to just give up on it entirely and binge watch tv or play video games instead.So actually feeling a little bit more productive than usual. Then I get an email from my boss."
Its a bore fest but he knows sad it makes me that kids today dont know cursive. You know yourself and how much you can handle. If its a bad look for you then change it. You got this. Stay strong.,The subject of our relationship status got brought up again and she said she was conflicted and part of her wants to just remain friends and part of her wants something more. I asked her if we could talk about it in person but we had to end up FaceTiming. It turns out all that flirting and leading on was her intentionally doing that to see if she was interested. What I took as affection turned out to be experimentation and at this point she was trying to avoid telling me the truth. Ive been rejected before but this one was different. She was leading me on for a month and a half and I thought I was really getting somewhere. The fact that she tried to feel that way for me and couldnt made everything worse. I know this may sound irrational but I cant help feel that there is something wrong with me and that Im screwed up and thats why this happened to me. Every time I put myself out there I get hurt and this one was a huge blow to the gut.
Ignore them. I truly believe everyone at the gym at first thinks all eyes are on them. Push through the uncomfortable and turn the other cheek. Crank your favorite song and zone the world out! I have immense admiration for you for all youve done thus far.,"I'm 19, I weigh 235 lb I used to be 250 at the beginning of the year, but it's really hard to keep exercising. Just today I was at the gym not 10 minutes ago and a couple of super skinny super hot girls just snickered at me. Part of it's probably because I'm paranoid but I feel like they were saying look at the fat girl trying to be like us Jesus Christ she doesn't f****** belong here. And so I ran home. I don't know if I can keep going to the gym and having those negative experiences. I'm just to anxiety-ridden and depressed to not go to the gym but at the same time when it's making those symptoms worse... I don't know I just need some encouragement."

Besides, people changes, so who is to know somebody will not come to become a soulmate to your future self?","I [19F] just broke up with my boyfriend [22M] I am heartbroken and lost. I met him a couple months ago and I fell so hard and so fast for him. Now I dont have anything. I knew he was the one, I knew he would be the one who I would marry and be there till the end. I have messed up so bad and theres nothing I can do. I feel so hopeless.. I lost my soulmate, he was and still is my everything. I dont wanna live my life without him.

My husband and I currently live in a low income apartment building which doesn't allow for full student households. He is in school and if I take classes we would have to find another place to live. All of this is stressing me out so much and my husband is stressed out and checked out. I need anyone to talk to but I'm afraid to talk to my friends about this. When I talk to my husband he doesn't say much. I just need even a shred of support from anyone because the person I need it from the most is not in an emotional or mental place to give that.

I asked for the babies items we received for our baby shower and he keeps telling me that I'm not getting anything that I didn't pay for. He takes things a step further by saying that he wasn't putting me on his insurance and I should get my fake family to pay for the hospital bill since they want to give fake speeches at the baby shower."

I'm just fried, and I miss my coping mechanisms of pedicures, massages, and spa days. They've been replaced by activities like hiking and meditation - its fun, but it's not what I really want. I come from a big family. We must update each other every week on how we have been. Negative points if you don't make the weekly Skype. Even more negative if you dont 'bring it'and show how you are 'crushing Covid.'I'm so tired. I have about 10% gas left in my tank. I just need a smile, or a nod, or a 'sup' just to say that regardless of where we are, it's going to be okay."

During this time from Wednesday to Sunday, I am uncomfortable and nervous. I am under the impression that I''m allowed to leave by myself but not with my son. He finally agrees that the hurricane is no longer a threat and that I could go home. I did allow him to see my son, and try to co-parent like he wished but after picking up my son on Tuesday morning and experiencing how my partner was still being aggressive with me, I finally realized how my emotional and physical safety was at risk.I called the police and reported the domestic dispute and he was eventually arrested and forced to do anger management.&amp;#x200B;After everything had happened, I decided to reconnect with him and try again. I knew this was a bad idea, but I wanted a family and I wanted my son to grow up with family. BIG MISTAKE. As soon as this happened, day by day, my partner was showing his true colors again."
"Its too much responsibility for a friend to have to talk you down from those close calls or not knowing the difference from a call for help and a joke.

I felt a deep bond between us.They read my proposal, and their reaction was basically holy shit.

I was looking at myself in the mirror, and I could feel my brain pulsating and *moving*, like it was rewiring so rapidly that it was causing a physical sensation. Ive never felt anything like it.I suddenly felt enormous guilt. It was as if the universe was angry with me. I had opened Pandoras Box.

While on his trip he was calling me to stay in touch. I encountered a few incidents where he was inappropriately interacting with women.Encounter 1- I hear a girl ask him ""who'se ass is fatter?"""
"""Now again, even if you aren't a Christian this is how I would respond:Are you going to be ok? Yes you will, but it depends on what you consider ""ok"". Worrying about how much you will make is honestly just not worth it.",We have two kids and the oldest will be starting preschool in a year or two. We still need to get another car for myself that's big enough for all four of us. And we really want to start thinking about buying our first house instead of renting. Are we going to be OK? Can someone just call me crazy and say it's going to work out?My wife's reaction was to start yelling that this is why she hates being with me. Nothing is ever good enough for me and I'm incredibly hard on my self because I want to be and to give my kids everything I didn't have. And I don't think I'll be able to with only $15/ hr.
"Hey friend. Im sorry you have to deal with this. If I could make a recommendation, Id suggest contacting a therapist or any other kind of mental health professional. I really hope youll be able to find a place you can move to. And I hope this Covid situation passesBest wishes.","I'm just alone in this big city, no license, no job, and the Covid19 situation makes it hard for me to connect to communities, to feel like I have a future. There are only a few places left that are affordable for low income people in Canada, and those places have high unemployment and are car dependent. I guess I wish I knew someone who was struggling financially and mentally ill, I'm so alone and scared in my own country.TLDR:I'm really scared living in Canada and being poor and mentally ill with the high rent, car dependent cities, and Covid affecting the economy."
Best wishes you'll smash it!,Wish me luck 
"I'm rooting for you!! I was terrified during my driving test. Breathe slowly. If you start to feel yourself getting anxious, take a breath before doing anything else. If you get stuck, talk to yourself ""okay, I know the way to fix this is to put the car in reverse and check my blind spots..."" or whatever, it tells the instructor you know what to do and gives you the time to calm down so you can follow through. You got this. You're capable and ready.","Hey there everyone! I am a Russian guy who desperately tries to get a driving license for himself but have failed miserably 3 times already. I am here for the 4th time trying to get into the right mindset to I finally accomplish what I want today but I am awfully nervous. The thing is that when I drive with an instructor from driving school where I went, I feel at ease and I relatively good at it but when it comes to passing the test and I have an officer riding shotgun who observes me driving, assessing me, I am get all messed up. I get so nervous that my mouth becomes dry, palms sweat, feet shake and I just cant get my mind straight. I am so mad because of that. I know that I have enough skill to pass the test but this nervousness gets the best of me. Please, encourage."

I know the scratches arent that bad, but my obsessive compulsive disorder really tests my tolerance when it comes to the smallest things. And it was a new phone that Ive only had for a couple of weeks, for crying out loud! Ive just been self deprecating for the past two hours, so far.In sum from all of this, how do I effectively diminish the thought of I could have done this to prevent this or that so I can learn from these small situations that have been bothering me for the past couple of hours? I guess I somehow have a compass as to how I can solve this, but hearing something from somebody else would really encourage me."
"Youre doing enough. Power through. Youve made it this long. Make it through the test. Then take a breather. 24 hours was a lot when I did it.

Looking back, I wish I had.","I am studying to get a bachelors degree and currently have a month of examinations in my school and I am beyond tired. I am also working 24 hours per week at job so I could live on my own, pay the bills, pay for food. Not a dream job, but it pays the bills. Tommorow I have an exam in a subject that I was not attending for almost half a semester because being there in lectures is just as useless as just not being there.(Was doing other homework in the meantime though, so suppose it was more useful to not be there in the end). About this particular subject I am completely clueless and I should gather my strengths today so I could get past 'fail' tommorow. But I just want to be lazy for once so badly ! I want to do something for my personal goals, I want to spend some more time with my boyfriend, I want to meet my mom, I want a whole day just at home."
Happy birthday!  I know you feel lonely and things aren't going great but keep your chin up!  I saw you posted that the pain is getting better so yay!!!  It will get better and if you need to chat you can reach out to me or post here again!   Have a great day!!!   *internet hugs*,Hello everyone!This is my first post on Reddit. I haven't been feeling too well lately I was throwing up and had a really low blood pressure due to anxiety ups and downs and I injured a part of my back on my birthday today and could hardly walk because of all the pain. Just felt kind of lonely since I have also had a hard time emotionally lately due to a lot of stress and don't really have friends or family like people that knew at all where I am and it's just raining the whole time lol. Still glad I have my bf with me :)Thanks everyone 
"The queer eye folks have one trick they use over and over: dress better and connect with people in a new way. This is your chance. Reach out to your father and husband in new ways. Oh yeah, and buy a couple new pieces of clothing and rock it :)",I guess I just have to do that for myself. I think I need to force myself to go out and talk to other people and do things to bring me in to connection with the world. I just feel like hiding under a blanket for the rest of my life. I of course can't do that. Wish I could be different as I constantly don't like myself. Not really sure what I'm asking.
Practice self care. Draw a bath with candles and bubbles. Exfoliate. File your nails. Put on a sheet mask/face treatment.,I cant do it. When Im heartbroken I get really bad depression. Im taking medicine for it but it still hurts. For once can I be treated right.. do I not deserve anything good in my life? Am I not deserving of love? Is there something wrong with me? Am I unloving.. I need encouragement that its gonna be okay because I have no one else.. Please help me.
It will always be no if you dont try!,Ive known this girl (Im a guy) for a while now. I really like her but I just cant muster up the courage to ask her out. I dont know if I should go do it.
"Hey Kev, I'm Mark (taking my mask off for a moment). If I may ask, what specifically about your life is weighing so heavily on you?","Right now Im sitting in my dark and empty house and I dont know if I can do this thing called life. Ive been battling this demon for years now. No one knows whats really going on with me. Ive tried to talk to people about it but they all have the same carbon copied answers - Youre gonna be okay. Itll get better soon. Im sorry youre going through this. I dont think I will though. I know I need to talk this out with a professional, but I cant afford that or the insurance to cover it. Its cruel how the world keeps on going after your own world lies in ashes at your feet. Tbh, I feel empty inside."
"I hope this gives you some encouragement. Just remember your wife is also there for you to talk about this stuff. We're all rooting for you, and I hope your studies go well in the  future! You can do it!","Well, I just got back my grade and it's a 37/100 and I'm panicking thinking this was all a mistake quitting my career to go back to school just to try and find a career I was actually passionate about. I'm enjoying learning but failing that bad has me in panic mode. I already struggle with depression and I'm hoping to benefit from talking with someone about it.

He's never used the word ""asshole"" on me before, so that's a new one. But anyway, I'm getting kind of sick and tired of him telling me this stuff. He always does it, and I'm starting to lose count of how many times he's verbally hurt me like this. You don't know how many times he's told me I won't have a future. After all, I'm out of the house in 4 years. He keeps reminding me of that like he doesn't want me anymore. I'm l just a Freshman, and I don't know what to do in life!

You. Are. Worth. Everything. My dad told me when I was 9 that Id had silver dangly bracelets on my wrists because Id be in jail. Im 25 and literally make twice what he does. He hasnt had a job in 15 years.,"Literally, the only thing that is keeping me together at this point is the internet. People encourage others and make people laugh, even though you don't know them. Under all the craziness of school drama and life, I can still find some good online. Anyway, I just need some tips on how to get my dad's words out of my head, or at least a link to a funny meme to cheer me up or something. I just need to stop overthinking all the stuff he yells at me for. I'm not good at explaining stuff, so can you just throw some comments at me? It seems like I'm just asking for attention, and now that I think of it, I probably am. I don't get any in real life, so let's just see if some random people online care!:)  why did i write this"

Don't let someone else convince you that because it's not guaranteed you'll land a job it's not a good idea to go back to school.,"I've been away from school for a few years dealing with personal things and now I'm finally deciding to go back. I have a lot of doubts and insecurities about how much money I'm spending on a degree that might not actually do me any good, especially since I took a few years off from getting it. But this is not a decision I'm making lightly, and it's one I've spent many many nights thinking about. It seems every time I bring up these fears with people they advise me to keep waiting until I'm sure, or to think about getting a different degree."
Know that you can accomplish anything you put yourself up to.Take it easy on yourself and take baby steps into working towards your goals. Be proud of yourself for first of all trying to get a job and for trying to better yourself.(:,"She knew I tried really hard and it wasn't my fault or hers or anyone else's that I didn't graduate. So, anyways her and I talked and she thought it would be a good idea for me to live on disability rather then get a job, so I applied. After 15 years of going to several doctors being diagnosed over and over again with Autism and 15 years of fighting to get on disability or any help for my Autism at all and being denied for any help and disability over and over again for 15 years I was done, I had enough. I just didn't want to keep being diagnosed and fighting for disability and stuff over and over, I was tired of it after 15 years of doing it. All those 15 years I never worked (because if you work or volunteer at all your automatically disqualified for any disability or help at all.) So, I didn't work or volunteer for anything those 15 years and now those years are gone and I can't get them back."

"Acting is scary. But i builds confidence. You will always start off shy, scared and nervous. But, that's how we all start. I joined the Drama class in my school and I was so afraid the first day. But as soon as the year went on the more I became confident in my skills and more comfortable. Just give it a go. Do something that scares you and you should do it bc you seem like you'd want to do if badly.","So, I really want to start up taking acting classes as I've always wanted to act, like really badly. There are plenty of teenage classes near where I live that I would love to try out but I don't have anybody to go with. Acting classes feel like a thing where people would definitely bring a friend along to help them feel less awkward and so i'm sure that everyone in the classes will have at least one person that they know.The problem I have is that none of my friends are remotely interested in acting and wouldn't join the classes with me. I'm trying to get the courage to go alone but right now i'm way too scared to sign up. Any advice on how to not be such a wimp or how to find a friend that likes acting?

Thank you for the awesome encouragement and comment! !!,"I'm 19, I weigh 235 lb I used to be 250 at the beginning of the year, but it's really hard to keep exercising. Just today I was at the gym not 10 minutes ago and a couple of super skinny super hot girls just snickered at me. Part of it's probably because I'm paranoid but I feel like they were saying look at the fat girl trying to be like us Jesus Christ she doesn't f****** belong here. And so I ran home. I don't know if I can keep going to the gym and having those negative experiences. I'm just to anxiety-ridden and depressed to not go to the gym but at the same time when it's making those symptoms worse... I don't know I just need some encouragement."

Im afraid that I wont be accepted or that people will treat me differently or like Im not normal if I do open up about this which is why Im deciding to ask a bunch of internet strangers in another sub that is more suited to my issue (sorry guys but this just isnt the right place for THAT encouragement) I really just need to be encouraged that it is ok to open up and dive into this self exploration. Im truly terrified of what others are going to say or do because of my upbringing (very religious, still am) and the nature of the subject at hand :/ I even went to far as to make an alternate account with a new email so my friends and family that use reddit cant find me on here and find out about this before Im good and ready to tell them."

It's a very technical and specialized position that I have absolutely no business being in. My boss liked me so I was promoted to this three months ago despite knowing fuck all what I was doing. Since then, I feel like I've done okay. Like I get the job done day to day but it's more like I know what to do, not why I'm doing it like that. My only resource for questions is a forum for this particular type of work for this franchise. It's the only one of it's kind. That's all I have. Anytime I have a question, that's practically my only resource short of toiling through thousands of pages of policy documentation to find what I need. Today I asked a question on the forum for clarification and was completely humiliated for it."
This is inspiring.,"And now, as i watch people tell me that they have no talent, and that nobody could love them, it hurts. I would give up so much to be bad at something again! To be able to scream loudly in the car or use all my paint just to draw something dumb. I would give up my life for some childish enjoyment.Even now, i have a hard time finding ways to feel alive, even if I've given up things like talent,, and the fear of being alone still haunts me every time i open my mouth to sing or pick up a pen to draw,, but i want everyone to remember something,,,Don't give up your happiness for approval. Dance badly in the rain, sing to your favorite song on the radio! Finger paint some fuckin' caterpillars. Annoy the shit out of people, and have the best damn time doing it.

Self-worship is a lonely religion. Children and society at large suffer because of it. You're doing the right thing to focus on being a good mother to your son.,I only did this because early in the day he was acting very strangely and purposefully start arguments with me out of thin air.
You survived open heart surgery. Your life is yours to live and do with what you want. This woman clearly is not in the right frame of mind to be a good partner to you. What she said was hurtful and reductive.,I now noticed since then things have gone downhill.Long story short she made me feel used worthless and broken. That I dont have my life together and cannot be a Provider. But I know these are not her words. Unfortunately nothing I say will bring her back. I just need some assurance Im not those things she said. Please.
Amen! Im glad your focus shifted towards Christ. This pandemic is certainly happening for all people to come to Christ and gain a deep relationship with Him and know how much we NEED Him.,"And I found the answer in a verse from bible, Romans 8:28~ and we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose The responsibility I have is to shift my identity and put it in God, because God is permanent. When I put my identity , of who I am in something permanent thats when there is no fear of losing peace, thats when I have nothing to be anxious of. Doesnt it answer our fundamental question. We lose so much of our lives in giving and focusing on temporary needs and dont realise the grave danger of losing out on hope. I found the answer in this Covid 19 situation and somehow Im grateful that I realised it. Im regaining my peace during the madness around me and I want to leave you with this exhortation to shift your identity to Jesus. Because all it took was a pandemic to shift mine in something permanent.."

"Thank you for posting this, I needed it today.","For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling.  I will walk before the Lord in the land of the living.Psalms 116:8-9 KJVThe psalmist often had to listen to the echo of their own prayers as they cried out to God from a place of isolation. Even if others are around, we can feel lonely if we forget that God is always there. We don't know who wrote Psalm 116, or in what circumstances, but the situation was dire (Seems hopeless). In verse Three he said the pain of death surrounded him and he found trouble and sorrow. During his isolation and fear, he called out to God, and beg God to deliver his soul (verse 4). But in verse 5 we find Gracious is the LORD, and righteous and merciful.No trouble is greater than God's power. Loneliness is a fiction since God is always with us. Call upon Him today and He will hear you, and draw near to you. Have a blessed day.   :)"

But I know logically silence is an answer, but how can someone say they love you then be so mean and just drop you from their life, that is not love.I would give anything I have to be held right now, just to be held, to feel wanted, to feel loved, and maybe even be together and remember what being alive means.

I desperately want to communicate this issue but she can already read it off of me (been together for a long time) which is making her mental health worse at times, and I think if we were to outright have that conversation it would cause her mental health to be even worse. She also gets upset that it seems like I view her as helpless and unable to function without me, and admittedly I do because shes so extremely needyI hate myself physically.

So I got a job in a completely different industry and now only make $15.50/ hr, about $30,000/yr. My wife just got a job making $13/hr.

Keep asking yourself what you must do. Eventually, you will end up at the beginning.By working backwards, youll break the task down into smaller units. Youll also have a sequence to follow.Check the units. Perhaps you can break them down into even smaller units.

It all started on Thursday ( some context I'm 16) I got a call during school lunchtime that my best friend Jay(18) had been arrested for assault, he had beat his sister's  abusive boyfriend half to death so I'll probably never see him again but then an hour later I hear from my good friend John that my friend Mike(15) will be moving out of state because he got his girlfriend pregnant. Oh and not being able to see 2 of my friends wasn't enough I got pulled into the counselors office and told that I will be repeating earth science and that I will be taking a course over the summer."
"I believe in you and your capability to one day become a doctor. Nursing could also give you a unique perspective on medicine, which is something that will set you apart from other applicants when you decide to apply. You've got this!","It was when I was put on academic recovery, I realized the consequences of what I had done and the potential effect it had on me wanting to achieve my goal of getting into a D.O school or M.D. School. It was then, I realized, I didnt want to live my life anymore. So I got help, and it was through that help I got to where I am today. I left that crowd behind, I gained control over alcohol and I actively pushed for my education cause at the end of the day I know I had a goal in mind of becoming a Neurosurgeon or just getting into D.O or M.D. school. So I went hard back to work and brought my grades up. My gpa at the end of my junior year was a 1.9 overall and now it sits at a 2.69. Now I know by no means, does this make me a competitive student or applicant despite my upward trend."
An opportunity to find yourself and know who you are and keeping up with that good eating habit,"I'm in a very strange period right now and I'm still trying to figure it out, but I'll try to describe it the best I can. Events in chronological order:During the quarantine, I took the time to workout and eat better. I had the discipline and the determination to lose weight and get fitter.Since June, work has been stressful, because of upcoming deadlines. I got me in a procrastination-due-to-anxiety state. My work isn't great, but it's not terrible either. I'm planning on getting at least decent results before July.This weekend, we got very bad news in the family.Since then, I feel like I want to lose control of my life."

"I don't know if this works in Canada, but I know for sure in the US you don't need a high school diploma to enroll in some two year colleges.","I don't want to get married and have kids (I'm not against those things, I just don't want them) and I don't want to have to do that simply because I'm female and Autistic. I feel the need to prove even if it's just to myself that I'm capable of more then cooking, cleaning, and making babies. I want to achieve my dream of being independent and having a career. I just don't know how possible that is, or even if it's possible at all. I had so many dreams as a kid of things I wanted to be when I grew up. When I was very young I wanted to be President Of The United States (I didn't know that as a kid born in Canada that one had to be born in U.S.A to be the President but I was a young kid.) I dreamed of being a lawyer or having my own business and owning a corporation."
hire someone to help you who can copy your style,Im a design student and we have this huge one year long project as a part of our final exam of highschool into university. It basically takes up 60% of the full grade for this subject. Im illustrating and writing a childrens picture book. I have two weeks left until its due. However I need 8-11 days to send it for printing and shipping. I have around 5-6 pages left and the cover pages. Also including the phrasing of the story. I was preoccupied with my trials(similar to the final big exams of all subject) so I didnt notice how much time I had left. I feel super anxious and stupid that I left so little time for myself even though I know Im bad with time management. What do I dooooooooooo:(((Ill ofc continue to work on it to the best of my ability and will force myself to finish it no matter what.
"Sending my love. Youre already prepared for the worst. Your father might be looking for some love and support from his family through something stronger than him. He might also be calling you all together to make things right in his heart before he passes. You have your siblings to rely on through this. My siblings were my greatest resource in a similar situation, and the passing of my father brought us closer. Be strong, exude love to everyone involved, and dont minimize your emotional health during your fathers difficult time. Best wishes to you all. ","Just looking for some encouraging words. My father is dying -we think based on his deteriorating heath for many years and age, and that he never really reaches out to us. He has been reaching out to each of my siblings to get together. It has fallen to me to arrange this. Im the youngest of 6, thought we are all in our late 30s and older. None of us is particularly close with him, so I didnt think this would be hard, but damn if it isnt really hard.   "
"It may be challenging but I believe you can do it! Way to go for taking the steps to pursue something you are more interested in! Like the other comments before me are saying, look for ways to get some homework help, maybe your college offers tutors through the school?","Well, I just got back my grade and it's a 37/100 and I'm panicking thinking this was all a mistake quitting my career to go back to school just to try and find a career I was actually passionate about. I'm enjoying learning but failing that bad has me in panic mode. I already struggle with depression and I'm hoping to benefit from talking with someone about it. I don't feel like I can talk to my wife about it.:("
"Ignore those girls.And, hey, if the gym isnt working out or making you feel uncomfortable, what about taking a break and working out at home? Backyard? Local park that no one visits?","There's a reason I work the evening shift. I know this is a petty thing to get hung up on in the face of such an otherwise-perfect opportunity, but it's been a VERY long time since I've been required to get up early on a regular basis. And now I'm on medication with a side effect of insomnia. My current situation is unsustainable, and these early classes will allow me to stick with my usual evening shift; but I have a long history of being easily discouraged and can already feel myself backpedaling. I need someone to talk me out of talking myself out of this."
"Either way, being honest with yourself and the important people in your life is the key to long-term peace of mind.","Jade and I have talked about our relationship and agreed we are friends. I think about her every day and sometimes wish I could be with her, but we only get one life to live.For most of this year we have not met but still chat regularly. I hope I can see her again soon.There are plenty of places I can go for criticism and Understand that, but if there is anyone who has a few words of encouragement it would be appreciated.If this post is met with silence, thats ok."
"Getting help may lead to new friends too. Right now, it sounds like you could use some.",And on top of that my mom kicks me out of the house for 4 hours and I don't have a car so I get to bike in a rainstorm and when I'm finally allowed back in she tells me that I need to fuck off and stop being bad at school. It feels like my life is over and that I'm falling under and that I'm trapped if you have anything to say I'm all ears

I finally have a job with tuition reimbursement and I'm going to get my benefits come this January. Sometimes I worry that I don't have what it takes to succeed and that even that even though in school I've made B's I'm worried my time away has made me less. What if I cant get B's anymore?
Happy Birthday!!! :) Hope you have a fantastic day!,"Good morning. It's 2/14, my birthday is today, I am in Indianapolis and have no friends here, I'm sad, I'm lonely, my family is far away, I could use kind words, love, peace, thanksgiving, anything. I just need kindness today. Friends too, I'm just rambling, just throw me some kindness, please. Thank you."
"I hear parenthood refocuses a person's priorities and perspective on life. The realization that a new human being -- their well-being, education, role-models, their entire future!-- depends on you *should* be a life-changing experience. Unfortunately, many parents seem unable to put their children first.","We get a late start to look for a room and of course all of them are occupied.We return to the common area, and he gets an attitude and starts to pout and scroll on his phone and refuses to do the activity with me in the common area."
"People survive their internships and live to tell the war stories later.=)Oh, and keep asking all the questions. If you ask enough questions, one of two things will happen:1) you will get the answers. OR2) people will get nervous and give the extra work to someone else.;)","It is now week 3 of my first ever internship and every day I come home feeling worse about myself and how things are going. I try to ask questions but a lot of times I feel like Im so confused I dont know where to start or my manager is not there and i dont even know who to go to for questions. When he is there and I ask questions he always seems to answer in a way that makes me feel stupid and like I should have just figured out the answer on my own. I am currently working on 3 projects and a couple side projects for my managers boss. Not sure if that is normal or not but I am feeling very  overwhelmed and anxious. Im just tired of coming back to my apartment everyday feeling like Ive accomplished nothing again, I am constantly wondering why I was hired for this position when I know so many others that would probably do better. I just want to feel like I did something right at work : ( "
But i made sure that I was saving enough to I could buy the stuff. I got on the bus.,"So I went from $60 to $8 cause I didn't know my netflix bill and hulu bill happened today. So after I bought drinks and two cool bracelets for myself, I didn't have enough money to buy my pizzas. I was at target and I had put two digornio's stuffed cheese pizzas in my cart and I was trying to check my bank finances cause I always get paranoid that money is going to disappear. But I had $40 after I bought my bracelets. So I knew I had enough....but when I saw I only had $8. My heart sank....because....I'm the type of person who never buys anything for myself because I have always been broke. I have been scammed out of money through my parents. I have had precious items sold from under my nose by family.....I once had a $100 electoric guitar and $50 amp bought for christmas one year....I didn't even have that for a year."
"Give things some time to straighten out, and straighten yourself out with it. Don't Force it too much right now. There are some communities that might be able to help you out here too. r/mentalhealth is one of them.","Ghosted by my college friends when I had a family medical emergency and had to withdraw from school, and my best friend blocked me on everything in December. The only explanation I can think of for getting blocked is that she was hoping this guy (who she said had major insecurity issues) would ask her out, and my assumption is that he made her block me.Student loans are beating me down because I dont know if its financially worth it to shoot for my dream. What good is it if I have to work a job in addition to my career just to pay off my loans?Im just having a rough time, and its getting to meEdit: I also find myself misdirecting my anger because Im so upset with my life. Thats actually what led me here"
"Your singing is actually pretty good. I think if you just keep practicing and learning from singing lessons, youll do great. Some of the other singers Ive seen play the guitar and sing in separate intervals, then mix the audios in editing. Maybe you can try that.","Ok so I'm pretty freaked out right now. Both because this is my first time posting, and because today I posted my first (and very rough) YT video.Some context: I live away from my family, they're in Indonesia and I'm in Sydney. I visit every year for Xmas, but this time it got sadder to go back to work after the holidays. I realised that I'd usually keep my head down at work for a whole year, and it started to feel sad and pointless. When I met up with a close friend while I was home, we talked about what really makes you feel happy, and singing is something that came up for as I felt it was like an outlet."
Sending prayers and vibes!,"Keep your fingers crossed, pray, or just send positive vibes my way please!"
I guess just try and make sure they don't ruin you for the next new people to come under you.  Can you take this to your supervisors and get them to smash some sense into these guys?,"I'm feeling really low. A few months ago on I was promoted to my first management position. I was so excited to be In leadership and I really thought I could make a difference in someone's career. About 2 months ago I got my team, all new hires, and almost all straight out of  college with little or no job experience. They are so rough. After rigorous training almost all of them are rough, to be expected of course.What I wasnt expecting is to have 4 HR issues right of the bat and them escalating me to leadership above me. I have 3 that are are written warnings for attendance, 1 more and will be termed. 1 went to my leadership and asked if I was right. Unfortently I so know this may happen as people might be unhappy, especially if they are having performance issues. All day my leaders tell me that i have such a bad team and they feel so bad for me, that I'm doing great handling it and it's really breaking me in."
"I am so sorry that you're dealing with all of this right now, and I so wish that I could say something that would help. I understand where you're at right now.","Im in too low of a funk to consistently care about maintaining my beard which is as frustrating as daily care would be. Ive been gaining fat all of 2020 which not only do I want to lose weight but Im also a nutrition major so thats not a good look. Ive been having toenail issues for about a year now, which tops it off for the head to toe partIm unemployed right now and couldnt get unemployment, so thats really rough. Im really thankful that money isnt as big of an issue as it would be for most people, but I find myself sitting in my car in a random parking lot just to get out of the house. I legit lost all of my friends in 2019 with not even the slightest explanation."
Maybe there are people in your class you could potentially reach out to and have study sessions?,Hi. I finished my original degree 17 years ago and have worked in IT since then but the past year had really made me fall out of \~\~love\~\~ like with that. I've wanted a masters for a long time with the idea that eventually I'd pursue a new career as a public policy analyst so I've gone back to undergraduate courses in economics and math with the idea if I do well I'll pursue a masters in economics but if not maybe public policy or political science or just go back to work. Of note I'm married with a 6 moth old daughter.Well...I showed up to my first calculus test (I originally passed it with an 89.6 in 2002 but am retaking it to prepare for calculus II) and the teacher told us we couldn't use our calculators and to put them away. We all panic. I didn't even finish the test.
"I don't always try my best because I get scared of success or failure or (imaginary) public opinion, or all the above. So maybe find a different way to redirect frustration or stress - whether it's through art, exercise, writing, music... whatever positive outlets you find meaningful.","I try to stay in my room and not make a mess. I try to get up with my niece and let my brother and sister sleep in when I am able. I haven't even been there 6 months. My sister in law expressed that she wanted me out last night. After they encourage me to go to my best friend's wedding in another state and get involved in a local sport (which cost money), I was informed that she was pissed that I had bought sports equipment the other night and that it was becoming time for me to leave. She wasn't mean about it. She just stated that it was time for her to have her space back. I'm worried that after all the changes I have been making, I'm back where I started. I'm in a job that can't sustain me financially. I don't know how I'm going to afford my bills if I move out by February."
