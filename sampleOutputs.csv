I will walk before the Lord in the land of the living.Psalms 116:8-9 KJVThe psalmist often had to listen to the echo of their own prayers as they cried out to God from a place of isolation. Even if others are around, we can feel lonely if we forget that God is always there. We don't know who wrote Psalm 116, or in what circumstances, but the situation was dire (Seems hopeless). In verse Three he said the pain of death surrounded him and he found trouble and sorrow. During his isolation and fear, he called out to God, and beg God to deliver his soul (verse 4). But in verse 5 we find Gracious is the LORD, and righteous and merciful.No trouble is greater than God's power. Loneliness is a fiction since God is always with us.
